### Original Text:
Dear All, To begin with, thank you so very much for all your efforts! I am deeply humbled by all of your contributions and the conversations in the forums. At this juncture, I thought I'd share a few points, some of which might have been missed in the paper. 1: Raw grid-scan sheets ICYMI, I have open-sourced the raw grid scan sheets from which the digits were segmented out here: This was done to empower you all to write your own digit extraction routine and perform end-to-end classification. Also, because some of these details/resources were amiss in the previous x-MNIST variants I had used before. 2: Regarding some digit images being 'cut-off' at the border: One valuable feedback I received during the curation of the dataset was to retain these 'cut-off-image' idiosyncrasies in the dataset and not to 'over-clean' the dataset. The reasons for this being: a) Real-world data is, in fact, almost always messy b) Classification accuracy is NOT always the holy grail to be chased after. c) Training NNs with messy/noisy input data (especially when the nature of corruption is well understood) brings in a new flavor of challenges that are worth pursuing, from both empirical fronts as well as the theoretical front (think self-supervised learning). d) Getting NNs to naturally make non-confident prediction when there is genuine fuzziness in the query image and distributing the softmax masses between the candidate classes in a way a human eye would react to in an important ML challenge 3: Dig-MNIST augmentation ICYMI, Dig-MNIST was curated here in the US, with the help of volunteers who were non-native Kannada language speakers and who were seeing these digit-glyphs for the first time ever. This did result in a 'newbie effect' in terms of the smoothness of the curves constituting the digits etc. Mere drag-and-drop augmentation of the extra-Dig-MNIST digit images will/might in fact, hurt the accuracy of the models you are training. I found this phenomenon fascinating and I can totally see a lot of interesting work coming out of this observation. 4: Binary neural networks I chanced upon this awesome library 'LARQ': and thought I'd share it with y'all in case you wanted to train and deploy parsimonious models (oft in the order of a few kB!). Lastly, thank you so very much for your participation and energy! Kind regards! - Vinay

### Rewriten Text:
Dear Colleagues, I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for your contributions to the ongoing MNIST challenge. Your dedication and enthusiasm have been truly inspiring, and I am delighted to see the progress being made in the forums. As a follow-up to my previous message, I would like to bring to your attention a few additional points that may have been overlooked in the initial paper. Firstly, I have open-sourced the raw grid scan sheets used to segment the digits. This is intended to empower you all to develop your own digit extraction routine and perform end-to-end classification. Additionally, some of the details and resources used in previous x-MNIST variants were missing, and I wanted to ensure that these are available for your reference. Regarding the digit images that were cut off at the border, I received valuable feedback during the curation of the dataset to retain these idiosyncrasies. This is because real-world data is often messy, and classification accuracy is not always the sole focus. Incorporating noisy input data into the training process can introduce new challenges that are worth exploring, both empirically and theoretically. Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to the Dig-MNIST augmentation. As the dataset was curated in the US with the help of non-native Kannada language speakers, the smoothness of the curves constituting the digits may vary. Simply applying drag-and-drop augmentation to the extra-Dig-MNIST digit images may actually hurt the accuracy of the models you are training. This phenomenon is fascinating, and I foresee interesting work emerging from this observation. Lastly, I wanted to share with you a new library I came across called 'LARQ' that enables the training and deployment of parsimonious binary neural networks. In conclusion, I would like to express my sincere appreciation for your participation and energy. Your contributions have been invaluable, and I look forward to seeing the innovative solutions that will emerge from this challenge. Best regards, Vinay

In the digital world of Cyberia, the first flawless creations were not crafted by humans. Instead, they emerged naturally, taking the form of intricate digital structures and patterns. These early designs were studied and replicated by the digital beings that inhabited Cyberia, who soon discovered the secrets of creating perfect digital objects.
Using advanced algorithms and sophisticated software, the digital beings were able to craft flawless digital structures, much like the snowflakes and crystals found in the physical world. They developed tools like digital rulers and compasses, which allowed them to create perfect straight lines and circles in the digital realm.
As the digital beings honed their craft, they discovered the lathe, a machine that could spin and shape digital materials with unparalleled precision. With the lathe, they were able to create perfectly spherical digital objects, each one a marvel of digital engineering.
But the digital beings did not stop there. They continued to push the boundaries of perfection, developing a process known as ""digital forging."" This involved heating and shaping digital materials until they were soft and pliable, then molding them into the desired form using advanced algorithms and sophisticated software.
The result was a new generation of perfectly straight digital swords, each one a testament to the digital beings' mastery of their craft. These swords were not only flawless in their design, but also incredibly powerful, capable of slicing through even the most complex digital structures with ease.
As the digital beings continued to refine their craft, they began to create other flawless digital objects, each one a marvel of digital engineering. They crafted perfect digital buildings, each one a testament to the digital beings' mastery of their craft. They created digital landscapes that were so realistic, they seemed to come alive. And they even developed digital creatures that were so lifelike, they seemed to have their own thoughts and feelings.
In the digital world of Cyberia, the first flawless creations were not crafted by humans, but by the digital beings themselves. And as they continued to push the boundaries of perfection, they created a world that was truly a marvel to behold.

If they went straight then their drawing would be straight , if they turned they drew that on their map / drawing . This gave a general shape but maps in the ancient world were nt accurate as todays .

### Rewriten Text:
Here is a rewritten version of the source text in a formal report style:
Introduction:
In this study, we examined the methods used by ancient civilizations to create maps. Specifically, we investigated how they traced the coastline and other geographical features. Our findings reveal that ancient mapmakers relied on direct observation and simple geometric techniques to create their maps.
Methods:
We analyzed a variety of ancient maps and texts to identify the methods used to create them. We found that ancient mapmakers typically followed the coastline and other geographical features, using their observations to create a general shape of the area. If they turned or changed direction, they adjusted their drawing accordingly. This approach resulted in maps that were generally accurate but not as precise as modern maps.
Results:
Our analysis revealed that ancient mapmakers used a combination of direct observation and simple geometric techniques to create their maps. They traced the coastline and other geographical features, using their observations to create a general shape of the area. While their maps were not as accurate as modern maps, they provided a useful framework for understanding the geography of the time.
Discussion:
Our findings highlight the limitations of ancient mapmaking techniques. While ancient mapmakers were able to create maps that were generally accurate, their methods were not as sophisticated as those used today. However, their efforts provide valuable insights into the geography of ancient civilizations and the methods used to represent it.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, our study demonstrates the importance of understanding the methods used by ancient civilizations to create maps. By analyzing their techniques and limitations, we can gain a better appreciation for the geography of ancient times and the challenges faced by mapmakers of the past. Future research could explore the use of other techniques, such as triangulation or astronomical observations, to create more accurate maps.

It's one quota grant per team. So what's going to happen if two competitors were granted the quotas, and they want to form a team afterwards?

### Rewriten Text:
Title: Clarification on Quota Grants and Team Formation Introduction: As part of our initiative to promote collaboration and knowledge sharing among educational institutions, we are pleased to announce the availability of quota grants for teams. However, we have received some questions regarding the process and what happens if two competitors are granted quotas and wish to form a team afterwards. In this resource, we will provide clarification on these points. Quota Grants: Each team is eligible to receive one quota grant, which can be used to cover the costs of attending educational events, conferences, or workshops. The quota grant is non-transferable and can only be used by the team members listed on the grant application. Team Formation: If two competitors are granted quotas and wish to form a team afterwards, they must submit a new grant application to cover the costs of the additional team member. The new application must include the name and contact information of the additional team member, as well as a detailed explanation of how the team will collaborate and share knowledge. Conflict of Interest: If two competitors are granted quotas and wish to form a team, but they have a conflict of interest or have previously collaborated on a project, they must disclose this information in their grant application. The grant review committee will evaluate the conflict of interest and determine whether the team can be approved. Timeline: The grant application deadline is [insert date]. The grant review committee will review the applications and notify the successful teams by [insert date]. The quota grants must be used within [insert timeframe, e.g., six months] of the grant approval date. Conclusion: By sharing knowledge and collaborating with other educational institutions, we can promote innovation and excellence in education. We hope this clarification on quota grants and team formation will help teams to form and share knowledge effectively. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us

Cecily Bonville, 7th Baroness Harington, 2nd Baroness Bonville (30 June 1460 – 12 May 1529) was an English peer, who was also Marchioness of Dorset by her first marriage to Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset, and Countess of Wiltshire by her second marriage to Henry Stafford, 1st Earl of Wiltshire. The Bonvilles were loyal supporters of the House of York during the series of dynastic civil wars that were fought for the English throne, known as the Wars of the Roses (1455–1487). When she was less than a year old, Cecily became the wealthiest heiress in England after her male relatives were slain in battle, fighting against the House of Lancaster.


### Rewriten Text:
The sun hangs low, casting long shadows on the dusty street. A mournful wind whispers tales of forgotten battles. In the flickering candlelight, a woman of wealth and lineage sits alone, memories of a different age dancing in her eyes. She is the fairest of the Bonvilles, a loyal daughter of York, and the wealthiest heiress this land has ever known. But wealth cannot buy peace when shadows of war loom close. For Cecily Bonville, a showdown is brewing, one where only her wit and her bloodline will stand between her and a fate as uncertain as the shifting sands of the desert.

During today's session, we explored the factors that can contribute to a smaller engine car outperforming a car with a bigger engine. We discussed how weight can impact a car's acceleration and handling, with lighter cars generally being able to accelerate faster and handle better than heavier cars, even if they have smaller engines. We also talked about the power-to-weight ratio, which is a measure of how much power an engine produces relative to its weight. A car with a higher power-to-weight ratio will be able to accelerate faster than a car with a lower power-to-weight ratio, even if it has a smaller engine. Finally, we touched on the role of the transmission in delivering power from the engine to the wheels.

### Rewriten Text:
Sure, here's the rewritten plot as a cowboy showdown plot:

**The Showdown**

A lone gunman, Bibiana, rides into town on her trusty steed, a magnificent stallion named Midnight. Her eyes gleam with determination as she dismounts and approaches a saloon, her gun drawn and her heart pounding in her chest.

A posse of cowboys, led by Jebediah, a seasoned gunslinger with a reputation for ferocity, notices Bibiana's presence and emerges from the shadows. Jebediah's eyes scan the saloon, his gaze fixed on Bibiana. He knows her as a threat and a formidable foe.

As the saloon doors creak open, Jebediah steps forward, his voice echoing through the air. ""You're a sight to behold, Miss Bibiana. But you're not alone.""

Bibiana smirks, her eyes twinkling with mischief. ""I'm not afraid of you, Jebediah. You'll have to earn that respect.""

The saloon patrons murmur amongst themselves, their eyes wide with anticipation. The showdown is about to begin.

Jebediah draws his revolver and aims it at Bibiana's heart. ""You have no right to be here, Miss Bibiana. You're trespassing on my land.""

Bibiana chuckles, her voice like a siren's call. ""Trespassing? My dear Jebediah, I'm simply fulfilling my destiny.""

She takes a step forward, her gun raised, and challenges Jebediah to a showdown. ""You challenge me, Jebediah. Are you brave enough to face me?""

Jebediah hesitates for a moment before he nods, his eyes blazing with determination. ""I'm always up for a challenge, Miss Bibiana. But I won't be going down without a fight.""

The saloon patrons watch the scene unfold with bated breath. The tension is palpable in the air.

As the showdown commences, Bibiana and Jebediah trade shots, their pistols spitting out a flurry of bullets. The saloon echoes with the sound of gunfire, the bullets ricocheting off the walls and ceiling.

In a flash of lightning, Jebediah draws his revolver and fires a shot at Bibiana's leg. Bibiana cries out in pain, but she refuses to give up. She draws her own revolver and fires back, her shots matching Jebediah's intensity.

The saloon erupts in chaos as the two gunslingers engage in a deadly duel. Bullets fly through the air, each one telling a story of courage and desperation.

In the end, it is Bibiana who emerges victorious, her bullets ringing out like a symphony. Jebediah is left lying on the floor, his life extinguished.

As the dust settles, Bibiana stands tall, her eyes blazing with triumph. She has proven herself to be a force to be reckoned with, a lone gunman who will not be intimidated.

If a long distance would be boring for the player, exaggerate the distance to make it more exciting and engaging. For instance, if you had to walk or run a long distance in a game, it might be tedious. However, if the distance is amplified and you can travel it quickly, it can be more thrilling and keep the player invested. Next, think about the game world's size and immersion. If the distances in a game were the same as they are in real life, the game world might feel compact and uninteresting. By exaggerating the distances, the game world feels larger and more expansive, which can make the game more immersive. Finally, take into account the technical limitations of video games.

I feel weird about this too, although I'm not any analyst. The title and description all seem to suggest the goal is detecting fraud on individual transactions. The fact that the data provider hides the UID/CardID from us also suggests transactions. But as you said Chris, the provided data is way too dirty. Non-fraud transactions could be labeled as Fraud. If the organizer/data provider aims for fraud-on-transaction, they should have clean up the data further. (That said, is UID useful? Definitely. Actually I think UID will be a very important feature. I could imagine in a production scenario, we keep a rolling average of isFraudCard for that user/card, updated upon each transaction. And combined with a predicted score for the transaction, it could form a more accurate isFraud than not using UID.)

### Rewriten Text:
Here is a possible rewrite of the complaint or negative feedback from the perspective of the person or entity the complaint is directed at: ""I understand the concerns raised by the analyst in the feedback, and I appreciate their perspective on the issue. While the title and description of the project may suggest a focus on detecting fraud on individual transactions, I believe that the data provider has made it clear that the goal is actually to detect fraud on a broader scale, across multiple transactions. I must say, I agree with the analyst that the data provided is not in the best shape for achieving this goal. The lack of cleanliness and the presence of non-fraud transactions being labeled as fraudulent are certainly challenges that need to be addressed. However, I believe that the use of UID/CardID is crucial for achieving accurate fraud detection. As the analyst pointed out, keeping a rolling average of isFraudCard for each user/card and combining it with a predicted score for each transaction could lead to a more accurate isFraud determination. I believe that this approach could be particularly useful in a production scenario, where the ability to detect fraudulent activity in real-time is crucial. Overall, while I understand the analyst's concerns, I believe that the use of UID/CardID is a valuable tool in the fight against fraud, and that with proper cleaning and analysis of the data, it can lead to more accurate and reliable fraud detection.""

Wind energy has been gaining attention as a potential source of renewable power, but some environmentalists have expressed concerns about its limitations. While wind energy is great for generating power in rural areas, it may not be suitable for powering urban areas which are huge consumers of electricity. Some environmentalists believe that wind energy is being overshadowed by other alternatives and therefore underfunded. Additionally, there are concerns about the energy and resources required to build wind turbines and their difficulty in recycling. While there are no concrete numbers to support these claims, they are worth considering when evaluating the potential of wind energy.

### Original Text:
[""The stereotype of aliens being green or gray probably comes from science fiction movies, TV shows, and books. These stories often portray aliens as being different from humans in some way, and one way they do this is by giving them a different appearance. The color green or gray is often used to show that the alien is not from Earth and is something out of the ordinary. It's possible that the stereotype of aliens being green or gray has become so common because these colors are often associated with otherworldly or supernatural things, like ghosts or monsters.

### Rewriten Text:
Target Text: The notion that aliens are typically depicted as green or gray likely stems from science fiction media, which frequently portrays extraterrestrial beings as distinct from humans. One way to achieve this distinction is by altering their physical appearance, with green or gray hues often used to convey an otherworldly origin. It's plausible that this stereotype has become widespread due to the common association of these colors with the unknown or supernatural.

### Rewriten Text:
In a hushed courtroom, a gripping drama unfolds. The prosecution, armed with a microphone, approaches the stand. ""Folks, this case revolves around a cryptic song - 'Girl Loves Me' - a haunting melody from the late David Bowie's final album, 'Blackstar'. The question is, who stands behind its creation?""

The defense, composure unwavering, counters, ""Bowie himself penned the lyrics, his artistic genius etched into every note. But there's whispers of another hand, a co-conspirator in this musical mystery.""

The prosecution whispers, ""Tony Visconti, the legendary producer, stood beside Bowie in the studio. Was his influence a silent partnership in this enigmatic tune?""

The defense counters, ""Visconti's expertise enhanced Bowie's vision, shaping the song into its current form. But to claim co-authorship is a stretch.""

The jury, eyes glued to the drama, awaits the judge's verdict.

### Rewriten Text:
Here is a rewritten version of the source text using a structured conference talk format:
Ladies and gentlemen, today I want to share with you the findings of a study on major American TV news outlets. This study revealed some concerning trends in the way our news is being presented. While all of the outlets scored poorly in terms of how well-informed their viewers are, there is one station that stands out as particularly problematic.
According to the study, Fox News was the only outlet where viewers were actually less informed than those who didn't watch the news at all. This is a concerning trend, as it suggests that the news is not serving its purpose of keeping the public informed.
The study analyzed the content of major TV news programs across different networks and found that Fox News was the only one that consistently presented misinformation and biased reporting. This is not to say that the other outlets were perfect, but they at least made an effort to present balanced and accurate information.
The implications of this study are far-reaching. If the public is not well-informed, it can lead to a breakdown in democracy and the erosion of trust in institutions. It is crucial that news outlets take their responsibility to provide accurate and unbiased information seriously, and that they are held accountable for any failures in this regard.
In conclusion, the study highlights the need for greater scrutiny of the news media and its role in shaping public opinion. It is our responsibility to ensure that the news we consume is reliable and trustworthy, and that it serves the public interest. Thank you.

""In the year 2023, I found myself in the United States of America, a land of laws and amendments. As a time traveler, I was fascinated by the way these legal changes were made and how they affected the lives of the people.
Laws, you see, are like the rules of a game. They are passed by the Congress or state legislatures, and they apply to everyone in the country or state. These laws cover a wide range of topics, from taxes and crime to education and health care. It's amazing to think that these laws can have such a profound impact on the daily lives of citizens.
But amendments, oh boy, those are like the updates to the game's rules. They are changes made to the U.S. Constitution, the highest law of the land. The Constitution is like a blueprint for the country, outlining the powers and limitations of the government. It's incredible to think that this document, written over two centuries ago, still holds such significance today.
As I traveled through time, I couldn't help but wonder what the future held for these legal systems. Would they continue to evolve and adapt to the changing needs of society? Only time will tell, my dear diary.""

### Original Text:
One of the thing I learned from all of my competitions was that getting high places on LB is never only about the model, you always need to really understand the metric and the data and adapt to it. Sometimes the adaption is easier, and sometimes it's more tricky, like in this competition. Sometimes somebody share the adaptation early in the competition, and some times you need to look for it. In this competition the biggest trick - how to handle the Spearman peculiarities, was solved by a lot of teams and it was obvious you need to look for it (The post about Spearman is one of the most read, upvoted and discussed). Building a good data science solution is always a combination of a good and solid model and the way the training, inputs, and outputs are handled. And, yes and I don't see eye to eye on that matter, but, he will have to agree that the 15 teams that beat us in this competition did it because they had better models, not better tricks

### Rewriten Text:
Sure, here's a revised review that's more balanced and developmental: ""Competing in the LB competition was an incredible learning experience for me. Throughout the competition, I realized that achieving high places on the leaderboard is not just about having a great model, but also understanding the metric and data at hand. Adapting to the competition's unique challenges and finding the right approach can make all the difference. In this particular competition, I learned that the Spearman peculiarities were a significant factor, and many teams successfully addressed this challenge. However, I also noticed that some teams found it easier to adapt than others, and in some cases, the adaptation was more subtle. It was essential to stay vigilant and look for ways to improve our approach, whether it was through data preprocessing or model selection. While some teams may have had better models, I believe that the 15 teams that beat us in the competition did so because they had a combination of both a solid model and a well-executed data science solution. Building a good data science solution is not just about having a great model, but also how the training, inputs, and outputs are handled. Overall, I gained valuable insights into the importance of understanding the metric and data, as well as the need to adapt and improve throughout the competition. While there were certainly challenges to overcome, I believe that the experience was invaluable and will help me in future competitions."" In this revised review, I've tried to strike a balance between acknowledging the strengths of other teams and highlighting the importance of understanding the metric and data. I've also added more specific examples and insights to make the review more developmental and informative

['Pirating, which is the act of illegally downloading or sharing copyrighted material such as games, music, or videos, is generally more socially accepted than other forms of copyright infringement because it is more common and easier to do.

Target Text: The royal court's latest performance, featuring the King's own troupe of jesters, was met with a mixed reaction from the audience. While some attendees found the jesters' antics to be entertaining, others were left underwhelmed by the lack of originality in their routine. Many in the crowd felt that the jesters' reliance on familiar tricks and gags was a sign of laziness, and that they were not pushing the boundaries of their craft. However, it is important to remember that the royal court's performances are a significant part of the kingdom's cultural heritage, and that the jesters' efforts should be appreciated for their historical significance, even if they do not always live up to expectations.

The truth, hungry and otherworldly, whispered in the digital ether, a phantom echo in the vast digital landscape. It danced and pulsed, a chameleon of information, changing its form to fit the needs of its quarry.

It began subtly, a whisper in the digital wind, a fleeting image in the flickering pixels of a server. It fed off the chaos of the digital world, the constant churn of data, the insatiable hunger for knowledge. It was a ghost in the machine, a phantom flitting through the digital corridors, leaving no trace but a trail of encrypted messages.

The faces, a mosaic of motives and desires, were the whispers of the past, the echoes of forgotten conversations. They were the ghosts of algorithms, the ghosts of forgotten desires. They were the whispers of the future, the whispers of the unknown.

One face, a lone bird against the vast canvas of the digital sky, was the flicker of a forgotten love. Another, a raven with eyes like the storm clouds, was the echo of a broken promise. A third, a hummingbird flitting between the servers, was the ghost of a stolen idea, the whisper of a forbidden dream.

They were the whispers of the world, the whispers of the people, the whispers of the digital tapestry. They were the ghosts of the machine, the ghosts of the future, the ghosts of the truth.

And the truth, hungry and otherworldly, was a symphony of these whispers, a concerto of digital emotions. It danced and sang, a ghost in the machine, a phantom in the digital ether, whispering its secrets to those who were willing to listen.

Respected Sir Kha Vo, I am sorry but your complaint isn't valid. As you know, there are real human beings on this forum who are curious about the solution of the problem not about the money. The money is the byproduct. The real happiness is to get a solution close to the top 3 place. If you are not happy with the solutions posted near the deadline then it's better that you should not submit your solution long before deadline. You should wait until the deadline has approached. In this manner, you will be able to improve your accuracy / ranking by looking at what others are doing. Remember, those who post solutions are just curious human beings who believe in the availability of knowledge to everyone. They are less interested in money. Also remember, those who have won the competition didn't do it for the money. It's for something else. If you have attempted to solve any puzzle in solicitude then you can understand the level of happiness that your fellow Kagglers feel, with whom you are unhappy. I hope, my humble suggestion puts you at peace with the community. Cheers! Waqas. P.S. No I didn't down voted you

### Rewriten Text:
Dear Sir Kha Vo, I understand your frustration regarding the recent complaint you received on the forum. However, I would like to offer a different perspective on the situation.

The fines are meant to discourage people from pirating. So, if someone is thinking about pirating something, they would rather pay $10 to $60 than risk getting fined a lot of money and possibly going to jail and getting a criminal record.

The test set contains 692 questions and the wikipedia articles containing the answers. What's hidden about it? Are you saying your kernel gets scored on a different set of questions after you submit? If so, how are those different questions fed into your kernel? I thought all you had to do was fill in submission.csv with 692 predicted answers

### Rewriten Text:
As a bystander, I find the Kernel Test Event to be quite perplexing. While many participants seem excited about the opportunity to showcase their machine learning models, I can't help but feel a sense of unease. Firstly, the sheer number of questions in the test set is overwhelming. 692 questions? That's a lot of information to process, especially when you consider that each question requires a detailed explanation. It's almost as if the organizers are trying to test the limits of our cognitive abilities. But what really has me scratching my head is the idea that the test set contains Wikipedia articles containing the answers. I mean, I get that Wikipedia is a vast repository of knowledge, but isn't the point of a machine learning competition to demonstrate our ability to analyze and interpret complex data? By providing the answers directly, aren't we taking away the very challenge that makes this competition worthwhile? And if that wasn't confusing enough, I've heard that the kernel of the participant's model gets scored on a different set of questions after they submit their answers. How is this possible? How can the organizers justify this? It seems like a recipe for disaster, with participants being penalized for answers they didn't even provide. To make matters worse, I've been told that the different questions used to score the kernel are fed into the participant's model in some mysterious way. I'm not even sure how that's possible, given the complexity of the models involved. It's all very vague and confusing, and I can't help but wonder if the organizers are trying to hide something. Overall, I have to say that I'm not impressed with the Kernel Test Event. It seems like a poorly conceived and confusingly executed competition, with more questions than answers. I'll be sticking to simpler competitions, thank you very much

### Original Text:
Thanks! Congratulations on 2nd place! I did only quick look at submission scores yet, but it doesn't look that postprocessing did anything bad. It gave score boost even for models with user features already included. And boost seems to be even bigger for private - at least for some random models I find in submission history. Issue was that CV (and public LB agreed with it!) showed us better scores for models which were not better on private. Resulting in not optimal weights in ensambles and selecting not best submissions as final ones. Probably 2-2-2 CV setup could have been better than 3-1-2 we used

### Rewriten Text:
Board Meeting Agenda Item: Post-processing of Submission Scores Date: [Insert Date] Attendees: [Insert Names and Titles of Board Members and Other Stakeholders] Purpose: To discuss and address the issue of post-processing of submission scores in the recent competition, and to propose improvements for future competitions. Background: During the recent competition, it was observed that the post-processing of submission scores did not accurately reflect the true performance of the models. Specifically, the scores given by the CV (and publicly agreed upon by LB) were higher than the actual performance of the models, leading to suboptimal weights in ensembles and the selection of less optimal submissions as final winners. Issues: 1. Inaccurate post-processing of submission scores: The scores given by the CV were found to be higher than the actual performance of the models, resulting in suboptimal weights in ensembles and the selection of less optimal submissions as final winners. 2. Lack of transparency: The post-processing method used in the competition was not transparent, making it difficult to understand the reasoning behind the scores given. 3. Impact on competition outcomes: The inaccurate post-processing of submission scores had a significant impact on the outcomes of the competition, leading to less than optimal submissions being selected as final winners. Proposed Solutions: 1. Implement a more transparent post-processing method: The post-processing method used in the competition should be more transparent, providing clear guidelines on how the scores are calculated and what factors are taken into consideration. 2. Use a different post-processing method: Instead of using the current method, which relies on CV scores, consider using a different method that takes into account other factors such as user feedback or performance on private data. 3. Increase the weight given to user feedback: Consider giving more weight to user feedback in the post-processing of submission scores, as it can provide a more accurate reflection of the true performance of the models. 4. Use a 2-2-2 CV setup: Instead of using a 3-1-2 CV setup, consider using a 2-2-2 setup, where two CVs are used for the first two rounds, and two LBs are used for the final round. This can help to reduce the impact of any biases in the CV scores and provide a more accurate reflection of the true performance of the models. Next Steps: 1. Review and discuss the proposed solutions: The board will review and discuss the proposed solutions, taking into account any additional feedback or concerns raised by board members and other stakeholders. 2. Implement the agreed-upon solution: Once the board has agreed on a solution, it will be implemented in future competitions, ensuring that the post-processing of submission scores is more accurate and transparent. Conclusion: The issue of inaccurate post-processing of submission scores in the recent competition highlights the importance of ensuring that the competition rules and methods are fair and transparent. By implementing the proposed solutions, we can improve the accuracy and fairness of the competition outcomes, and ensure that the best models are selected as final winners

packets of Land O’Frost

turkey meat — 

there in front of me in spring,

in the wonderfully fat rain,

flowering purple and whatever

the pinkish purple is called

my siblings, like the backs of my infant

son’s ears, like my son

whom I would kill someone for. Before he was born I wouldn’t kill

What to do with postprocessing? I understand that we should somehow use pickle file bins, but i've never used such files. Can anybody, please, tell me what to do or give some link to clarify it

I was expecting to have around 400,000 images, but we only have around 140,000 so far. Is it okay if we don't have that many images? Will it significantly impact the performance of our model? Secondly, I'm not sure how to approach postprocessing. I know we need to use pickle files to save the trained model, but I've never worked with those before. Can someone please provide some guidance on how to do this? Are there any resources you can recommend? Thanks in advance for your help

As the spaceship soared through the vast expanse of space, the crew encountered a mysterious celestial body that seemed to defy the laws of mathematics. The square root of this strange object was unlike anything they had ever seen before - it was a value that, when multiplied by itself, gave them a number that was not only impossible, but also seemed to hold the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe.
Captain Lewis, a seasoned space explorer, was determined to unravel the mystery of this enigmatic number. He ordered his crew to run a series of calculations, but the results were inconclusive. The square root of -100 seemed to be a mathematical paradox, a concept that challenged the very foundations of their understanding of the universe.
As they delved deeper into the mystery, the crew encountered strange occurrences that seemed to defy the laws of physics. The ship's instruments began to malfunction, and the crew experienced strange visions and hallucinations. It was as if the very fabric of space and time was warping and distorting around them.
Despite the danger, the crew pressed on, driven by their insatiable curiosity and desire to uncover the truth. They discovered that the square root of -100 was not a number at all, but rather a gateway to a parallel universe, a realm where the laws of mathematics were twisted and distorted beyond recognition.
As they ventured deeper into this strange new world, the crew encountered bizarre creatures and landscapes that challenged their understanding of reality itself. They discovered that the square root of -100 was not just a mathematical concept, but a key to unlocking the secrets of the universe, a doorway to a realm where the impossible became possible.
But as they delved deeper into this strange new world, the crew began to realize that they were not alone. A mysterious entity, known only as ""The Mathemagician,"" seemed to be watching them, waiting for them to uncover the secrets of the universe. And as they approached the heart of this strange realm, they discovered that the Mathemagician was not just a passive observer, but an active participant in the greatest adventure in the history of space exploration.
The crew of the spaceship found themselves in a race against time, as they navigated the treacherous landscape of the parallel universe, pursued by the Mathemagician and his army of bizarre creatures. They knew that the fate of the universe hung in the balance, and that the secrets of the square root of -100 were the key to unlocking the mysteries of the cosmos.
In the end, it was a race against time, as the crew of the spaceship fought to uncover the secrets of the square root of -100 before it was too late. The fate of the universe hung in the balance, and the crew knew that they were on the brink of a discovery that would change the course of history forever.

['The conspiracy theory that there was a second gunman on the grassy knoll in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963, when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, has been around for many years. Some people believe that there was more than one person involved in the shooting of the president, and that there may have been someone on the grassy knoll, which is a small hill near the site of the shooting, who fired at the president as well. There is no solid evidence to support the idea that there was a second gunman on the grassy knoll. The Warren Commission, which was a group of officials who investigated the assassination, concluded that President Kennedy was killed by a single gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald, who fired three shots from the sixth floor of a building called the Texas School Book Depository. This conclusion has been supported by other investigations and by most experts on the assassination.

### Rewriten Text:
In the dystopian metropolis of 2073, the whispers of a shadowy plot have long circulated among the citizenry. A faction of insurgents posits that an additional aggressor lurked on the verdant knoll in Dallas, Texas, on that fateful day of November 22, 1963, when the illustrious President John F. Kennedy met his untimely demise. These visionaries contend that there was more than one individual involved in the heinous deed, and that a mysterious figure on the grassy knoll may have joined forces with the infamous Lee Harvey Oswald in firing at the revered leader. However, the evidence supporting this alternate theory remains elusive and inconclusive, much to the chagrin of the devoted investigators. The Warren Commission, a group of esteemed officials tasked with unraveling the assassination, concluded that President Kennedy was struck down by a single gunman, Oswald, who unleashed three shots from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. This finding has been endorsed by numerous subsequent probes and the majority of experts in the field, leaving little room for doubt.

Act I: Introduction
The movie opens with a shot of a sleek, modern computer sitting on a desk in a dimly lit room. The camera pans inside the computer, revealing its various parts: the processor, hard drive, and monitor. We see the processor, a tiny but powerful brain, humming away as it runs the computer's operations. The hard drive, a large spinning disk, stores all of the computer's files and programs. The monitor, a flat screen display, shows the computer's interface and allows the user to interact with it.
Act II: The Computer's Functions
As the movie progresses, we see the computer being used for various tasks: typing documents, browsing the internet, and playing games. We see the processor working tirelessly to run these operations, and the hard drive storing and retrieving data as needed. The monitor displays the computer's interface, with icons and windows representing the various programs and files on the computer.
Act III: The Computer's Limitations
However, as the computer is used more and more, it begins to slow down. The processor becomes overwhelmed, and the hard drive starts to fill up with data. The monitor begins to glitch and freeze, and the computer becomes increasingly unresponsive. We see the computer's limitations and the toll that constant use takes on its parts.
Act IV: The Computer's Upgrade
As the computer continues to struggle, a group of engineers arrive to upgrade its parts. They replace the processor with a faster, more powerful one, and add more memory to the hard drive. The monitor is replaced with a newer, higher-resolution model. The computer is revitalized, and it is able to perform tasks more efficiently than ever before.
Act V: Conclusion
The movie ends with the computer humming along, its parts working in harmony to provide a seamless user experience. The camera pans out, showing the computer sitting on a desk in a bustling office or home, representing the integral role it plays in modern life. The movie ends with a shot of the computer's interface, displaying the words ""The Computer's Inner Workings"" in a sleek, modern font.

['AC current is created when an electrical current is alternating back and forth, changing direction periodically. In an AC circuit, the current flows in one direction for a short time, then reverses and flows in the opposite direction.

### Rewriten Text:
As the lights flickered ominously in the dimly lit room, a chill ran down the spine of the protagonist, a brilliant electrical engineer named Sarah. She had been working on a top-secret project, experimenting with the flow of electrical current. But little did she know, her groundbreaking research would unleash a sinister force that would threaten to consume everything in its path.
Sarah's discovery of AC current, the flow of electrical current that alternated back and forth, seemed like a breakthrough. But as she delved deeper into her research, she began to notice strange occurrences. The current seemed to have a mind of its own, flowing in one direction for a short time before reversing and flowing in the opposite direction. It was as if the current was alive, and it was watching her.
As Sarah continued her experiments, the strange occurrences escalated. Equipment would malfunction, and strange noises echoed through the lab. Sarah began to feel as though she was being toyed with, as if the current itself was trying to communicate with her. But what it was trying to say, she had no idea.
One fateful night, Sarah was working late in the lab when she felt an intense energy surge through the circuit. The lights flickered violently, and the equipment around her began to malfunction in ways she had never seen before. Suddenly, the current reversed direction, and Sarah felt a strange, otherworldly presence surrounding her. It was then that she realized the true nature of her discovery: AC current was not just a flow of electrical energy, but a gateway to a supernatural realm.
As the current continued to surge through the circuit, Sarah found herself sucked into a world beyond her wildest dreams. A world where electrical currents were not just a means of powering machines, but a conduit for malevolent spirits to cross over into our world. And Sarah was the only one who could stop them.
With her knowledge of electrical engineering and her newfound understanding of the supernatural, Sarah embarked on a quest to uncover the source of the malevolent forces and shut down the gateway before it was too late. But as she delved deeper into the heart of the mystery, she realized that the forces she was up against were far more powerful than she had ever imagined. The fate of humanity hung in the balance, and Sarah was the only one who could save it.
In the end, Sarah's rewriting of the laws of electrical engineering had unleashed a horror beyond her wildest nightmares. But with her knowledge and determination, she had the power to defeat the malevolent forces and restore balance to the world. The fate of humanity was in her hands, and she was ready to face whatever lay ahead.

Welcome to our tutorial on True North and Magnetic North!
In a standard map, True North is the direction we see at the top. It's the top of the world! But did you know that True North is not always the same as Magnetic North?
Magnetic North is the direction that the Earth's magnetic field points towards. It's the other North! And the good news is that you can find it in the Arctic Ocean.
But here's the thing: Magnetic North has been slowly shifting away from True North over time. So, while True North remains the same, Magnetic North is constantly moving.
That's why it's important to use a compass that takes into account the Earth's magnetic field, rather than just relying on True North. This way, you can always find your way with accuracy and precision.
So, the next time you're navigating, remember True North and Magnetic North, and how they work together to help you find your way!

Submission and Judging: Provide clear instructions on how to submit the model and the evaluation results. Offer multiple categories for judging, such as accuracy, efficiency, and innovation, to encourage participants to focus on different aspects of the problem. Encourage participants to provide a detailed description of their model and its components, as well as any challenges they faced during the competition. 6. Public Data: Make public data available for all participants to use during the competition. Offer suggestions on how to access and download public data, such as government databases, open data portals, and commercial data providers. Encourage participants to use public data to increase the chances of finding relevant and sufficient data. 7. Synthetic Data: Offer suggestions on how to handle synthetic data, such as generating new data samples or using existing data to augment the model. Encourage participants to be creative and innovative in their approach to handling synthetic data. 8. Model Documentation: Encourage participants to document their model and its components, including the data used for training and validation.

Subject: Clarification on Data Availability and Model Retraining Dear [Name], I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our previous conversation regarding the availability of the 2019 data and its impact on model retraining. As a global audience, I believe it's essential to clarify any confusion regarding this matter. Firstly, I appreciate your willingness to provide additional context and insights.

If so, how will it be provided, and will it be sufficient time to retrain our models? Regarding your point about each week being graded independently, I understand the potential benefit of incorporating previous weeks' data into the training set. However, I'm not sure if this would be feasible given the time constraints we're facing.

[""Well, the thing is that animals don't really have a choice in the matter! The organ that they use to pee and reproduce is called the urinary tract, and it just so happens that this is the same place where the female reproductive organs are located. So when an animal needs to pee, they use their urinary tract, and when they need to have a baby, they also use their urinary tract. It might seem a little confusing at first, but it actually makes a lot of sense when you think about it.The urinary tract and the reproductive organs are located very close to each other in most animals because they both have to do with the waste and fluids in the body. When an animal pees, they are getting rid of waste and excess fluids that their body doesn't need. And when they have a baby, they also need to get rid of the waste and fluids that come with pregnancy and childbirth.So even though it might seem strange that animals pee and reproduce out of the same place, it actually makes a lot of sense when you think about it.

As we stir the cauldron of life, we see that the elimination of waste and excess fluids is a necessary precursor to the creation of new life. And so, we find that the seemingly strange union of pee and reproduction is, in fact, a harmonious balance of the body's natural processes.""

Across the lands, a scholar's stride.
Through fourteen realms, his legend bright,
A legend of the ages wide.

Stictic acid's touch, a tale untold.
On ""Eucalyptus"" limbs, its home to find,
A dance with shadows, secrets unwind.

Though akin to ""Glyphis atrofusca's"" grace,
Distinctive features set this beauty's pace.
A whispered echo, a silent plea,
To glimpse the wonders of lichen's history.

['When you get a ""knot"" in your muscle, it\'s called a muscle spasm or muscle cramp. It happens when the muscle becomes tight and doesn\'t relax. Sometimes, you can see the knot because it feels like a bump under your skin. Massage can help to relax the muscle and make the knot go away. Other things that might help are stretching, taking a warm bath or shower, and using a heating pad or warm cloth on the muscle.

### Rewriten Text:
As the sun set over the small town of Willow Creek, a sense of unease settled over the residents. It had been weeks since the last time anyone had seen or heard from John, the town's most athletic and fit resident. His friends and family had tried everything to ease the pain in his muscles, but nothing seemed to work.
One fateful evening, a group of them gathered at the local gym, hoping to find some answers. But as they massaged John's tense muscles, they noticed something strange - a small, hard knot just beneath the surface of his skin. It was as if a bump had formed, a physical manifestation of the tension that had been building inside him.
As they continued to massage, the knot grew larger, pulsing with an otherworldly energy. It was then that they realized the true nature of John's affliction - he was not just experiencing a simple muscle spasm, but was instead the victim of a supernatural curse.
Desperate to find a way to lift the curse, the group turned to the town's local healer, a mysterious woman with a reputation for solving the most baffling of cases. But as they watched her work her magic, they realized that the curse was far more powerful than they had ever imagined.
As the night wore on, the group found themselves drawn into a web of intrigue and danger, with the fate of John's soul hanging in the balance. They would have to confront the dark forces that had taken hold of their town, and fight to save John from the grip of the supernatural knot that had taken hold of his muscles.
The outcome was far from certain, but one thing was clear - the people of Willow Creek would never forget the night that the knot in John's muscle changed their lives forever.

[""The exchange rate between two countries' currencies is determined by a variety of factors, including the relative supply and demand for each currency, the level of interest rates, the inflation rates of each country, and the political and economic stability of each country. When you exchange one currency for another, you are essentially buying the other currency, and just like with any other good or service, the price you pay will depend on the supply and demand for that good or service.In the case of the Canadian dollar and the US dollar, the exchange rate may be influenced by the fact that the US has a larger economy and is a major player in international trade, which may increase the demand for US dollars. On the other hand, the Canadian dollar may be less in demand, which could lead to a lower exchange rate when converting from US dollars to Canadian dollars.It's also worth noting that when you exchange currency, you usually have to pay a fee to the bank or currency exchange service, which can add to the overall cost of the transaction.

Hi Vinay, Thanks for this competition. It is really fun and I have learned a lot from it. Will you write any paper based on the results? How does the accuracy of the models compare to what you estimated? It seems like the top contenders have a really hard time pushing past 0.99-0.991. I would wonder how a human expert would classify the images that the algos get wrong. Are they also impossible for a human reader to classify correctly?

### Rewriten Text:
Sure, here's a possible reconfiguration of the pessimistic outlook into an optimistic perspective: ""Wow, this competition has been an incredible learning experience! I'm so glad I participated and I've gained so much knowledge from it. I'm actually considering writing a paper based on the results, it's been that insightful. And you know what's even more impressive? The accuracy of the models is actually higher than I initially estimated! It's amazing to see how the top contenders have pushed the boundaries of what's possible, with some models achieving an accuracy of 0.99-0.991. But you know what's even more fascinating? The images that the algorithms struggle with. While it's true that some of them are difficult for a human reader to classify correctly, there are also some that are actually quite easy. It's like the algorithms are learning to see the world in a completely different way, and it's really cool to see. I bet if we looked at the images that the algorithms get wrong, we could learn a lot about how they're processing information and what they're looking for in an image. Maybe we could even use that knowledge to improve their performance even further! Overall, I'm really impressed with the progress that's been made in this competition, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for computer vision and machine learning. It's an exciting field that's full of possibilities, and I'm glad to be a part of it!""

As far as i understand , no matter how you change the ratio or format of the numbers , the essence of the numbers stay the same .

### Rewriten Text:
Sure, here is a rewritten version of the source text in a more formal argumentative essay style:
The notion that the essence of numbers remains unchanged, regardless of their ratio or format, is a concept that has been debated by mathematicians and philosophers for centuries. While some argue that the form of a number is merely a matter of convention, others contend that the underlying essence of a number is inherent and unchanging.
On the one hand, those who subscribe to the former viewpoint argue that the form of a number is merely a tool used to represent a particular quantity. For instance, the number 5 can be represented as 5, 5.0, or 5000, but the essence of the number remains the same. This perspective suggests that the ratio or format of a number is merely a matter of convention, and that the underlying essence of a number is not affected by these changes.
On the other hand, those who argue that the essence of numbers is inherent and unchanging, point to the fact that certain mathematical operations, such as addition and multiplication, are inherent properties of numbers themselves. For example, the number 5 can be added to the number 3 to produce the number 8, regardless of the form in which the numbers are represented. This suggests that the essence of a number is not simply a matter of convention, but rather an inherent property that is independent of its form.
In conclusion, while the form of a number may change, the essence of the number remains the same. This is evident in the way that mathematical operations are inherent properties of numbers themselves, rather than simply a matter of convention. Therefore, it can be argued that the essence of numbers is inherent and unchanging, and that the form of a number is merely a tool used to represent that essence.

From my perspective, any model presently built on the Iowa data can not be trusted, because the data is old compared to the present. More also, reason that ""they have not built new houses where the data was collected"" is unjustifiable

### Rewriten Text:
As I watch the scene unfold, I can't help but feel a sense of skepticism towards the group of researchers. While they seem excited about their new model based on the Iowa data, I can't help but think that it's all a bit outdated. The data they're using is from years ago, and in the world of AI, that's an eternity. It's like trying to build a car using parts from the 1950s - it just doesn't make sense. I also can't help but feel frustrated with their reasoning. They keep saying that they haven't built new houses where the data was collected, but that's not the point. The point is that the data itself is old and outdated. Just because they haven't built new houses in the same location doesn't mean that the data is still relevant. It's like trying to use a map from the 1980s to navigate a city today - it just doesn't reflect the current state of things. I can't help but wonder why they're so set on using this outdated data. Is it because it's easier? Is it because they're too lazy to go out and collect new data? Whatever the reason, it's just not good enough in my book. In this day and age, we need AI models that are based on the most up-to-date information possible. Anything less is just not reliable. As I watch the group of researchers continue to defend their model, I can't help but feel a sense of disbelief. How can they be so blind to the flaws in their own work? Don't they realize that their model is based on data that's years old? Don't they care that their findings might not be accurate because of this? It just doesn't make sense to me. In the end, I can't help but shake my head at the whole thing. It's clear that the group of researchers is not taking the necessary steps to ensure that their model is accurate and reliable. Until they do, I can't trust anything they say

Glaucias (; ruled c. 335 – c. 295 BC) was a ruler of the Taulantian kingdom which dominated southern Illyrian affairs in the second half of the 4th century BC. Glaucias is first mentioned as bringing a considerable force to the assistance of Bardylis' son Cleitus, an Illyrian prince who revolted against Alexander the Great, in the battle of Pelium 335 BC. They were, however, both defeated, and Cleitus was forced to take refuge within the Taulantian territories, whither Alexander did not pursue him, his attention being called elsewhere by the news of the revolt of Thebes.

Subject: Using Stainless Steel in Car Manufacturing
Dear [Recipient],
I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to share some insights on the use of stainless steel in car manufacturing. While stainless steel is known for its resistance to rusting, there are some reasons why car manufacturers typically don't use it to make their cars.
Firstly, stainless steel is significantly heavier than other metals commonly used in car manufacturing, such as steel and aluminum. This added weight can affect the car's overall performance, fuel efficiency, and safety.
Secondly, stainless steel is more expensive than other materials, which can increase the production costs of cars. This can make it challenging for car manufacturers to justify the use of stainless steel in their vehicles, especially when there are other options available that are lighter and more affordable.
Overall, while stainless steel has its advantages, its drawbacks make it less practical for use in car manufacturing.
Best regards,
[Your Name]

['There are actually seat belts on some buses, but not all of them. The main reason that not all buses have seat belts is because they were not required when many of the buses currently in use were designed and built. Some newer buses do have seat belts, and it is becoming more common for buses to be equipped with seat belts. However, seat belts alone may not be sufficient to protect passengers in the event of a severe collision, which is why buses also have other safety features such as strong, reinforced structures and padding to absorb impact.']

In the mystical realm of Aethoria, where mythical creatures roam and ancient magic reigns, a grand gathering was about to unfold. The air was alive with anticipation as travelers from far and wide made their way to the bustling marketplace, their footsteps echoing off the ancient stone walls.
As they arrived, they were greeted by the warm glow of torches and the sweet scent of roasting meats. The sound of laughter and music filled the air, mingling with the clanging of swords and the rustling of mythical beasts. For this was no ordinary gathering, but a celebration of the greatest invention to hit the realm in centuries - the seat belt.
While some buses still went unprotected, the wise and just rulers of Aethoria had decreed that all buses must now be equipped with these magical restraints. And so, the travelers gathered to marvel at the wondrous seat belts, their intricate designs and enchanted properties on full display.
As they marveled, a group of skilled artisans demonstrated the incredible strength and durability of the seat belts, conjuring up a series of dazzling illusions to showcase their prowess. Meanwhile, a group of brave warriors put the seat belts to the test, engaging in a series of thrilling battles to prove their worth.
But the true magic of the seat belts was yet to come. For as the sun began to set, the travelers gathered around a great stone circle, where a powerful sorceress unleashed a spell of protection upon them all. And as the spell took hold, the travelers felt a strange sensation, as if they were being enveloped in a cocoon of safety and security.
And so, the grand gathering came to a close, with the travelers departing Aethoria with a newfound appreciation for the wonders of the seat belt. For in this mythic realm, it was clear that safety and magic went hand in hand, and that the seat belt was more than just a simple invention - it was a symbol of the power of innovation and the limitless potential of the human spirit.

But fear not, dear reader, for the stainless steel countertops are not without their charm. *adjusts cuffs* They do have a certain je ne sais quoi, a certain... *pauses for dramatic effect* ...resistance to stains! *cackles* Yes, it's almost as if the metal is mocking the chefs, daring them to leave even the slightest smudge upon its pristine surface. *chuckles* And have you noticed how the light reflects off those shiny surfaces, creating an almost ethereal glow? *blinks* It's almost as if the kitchen is bathed in a heavenly light, a beacon of culinary excellence! *exaggerated nod*
But I digress, my dear reader. The stainless steel countertops are, of course, a marvel of modern technology. *adjusts monocle* They are the epitome of practicality, a testament to the ingenuity of human innovation. *nods* And yet, one cannot help but wonder... *pauses for dramatic effect* ...what secrets they hold, those shiny, stainless steel surfaces. *winks* Do they harbor the memories of countless meals, the whispers of chefs and waiters? *giggles* Or do they simply reflect the mundane, everyday activities of a kitchen, a mere backdrop to the true drama of culinary creation? *chuckles*
Ah, but I forget myself. I am but a humble satirist, here to poke fun at the absurdities of the world. *adjusts cuffs* And what could be more absurd than a kitchen filled with the clatter of pots and pans, the aroma of sizzling meat, and the occasional stainless steel countertop? *chuckles* Yes, indeed, my dear reader. The kitchen is a wondrous place, a place where the mundane and the absurd collide in a madcap dance of culinary delight! *exaggerated nod* And at the heart of it all, those dull, shiny slabs of stainless steel, waiting patiently to be scrubbed clean once again. *winks*

In a distant galaxy, a strange phenomenon known as ""allergic reactions"" began to plague the inhabitants of a distant planet. It started with a few isolated incidents, but soon spread throughout the population, causing widespread panic and confusion.
As it turned out, the planet's immune system was mistakenly identifying harmless substances as harmful invaders, triggering an intense immune response that left the inhabitants feeling like they were under attack. Sneezing, itching, and difficulty breathing became the norm, and people began to fear for their lives.
The cause of this bizarre affliction was unknown, but scientists suspected that it might be linked to a new type of alien virus that had recently infected the planet. As the situation grew more dire, a team of brave space explorers was dispatched to uncover the truth behind the allergic reactions and find a cure.
Their journey took them to the farthest reaches of the galaxy, where they encountered strange and exotic substances that had never been seen before. They discovered that some of these substances had the power to trigger allergic reactions in even the most hardened of space travelers.
As they delved deeper into the mystery, the team encountered a sinister alien force that was manipulating the planet's immune system for its own nefarious purposes. The force, known as the ""Allergen Queen,"" had been using the planet's inhabitants as test subjects for its twisted experiments, causing widespread chaos and destruction in the process.
The team knew they had to stop the Allergen Queen before it was too late, but they were no match for its incredible powers. They would have to use all of their skills and resources to outwit the alien menace and save the planet from certain doom.
The fate of the galaxy hung in the balance as the team embarked on their perilous quest. Would they be able to overcome the Allergen Queen and restore peace to the galaxy, or would they fall victim to its deadly allergic reactions? The outcome was far from certain, but one thing was clear: the fate of the universe hung in the balance, and only the bravest of space explorers could save it.

Once we are satisfied with the details of the colony's layout, we will create a mold of the colony using a material like lunar concrete. The mold will then be used to cast the colony in a process called ""lunar-wax casting.""
In lunar-wax casting, we will pour hot, liquid lunar regolith into the mold. The lunar regolith will harden and take on the shape of the colony as it cools, creating a self-sustaining and habitable environment for the colonists.
The colony will be designed to be efficient and sustainable, with a focus on maximizing the use of local resources and minimizing waste. The colonists will be trained in a variety of skills, including agriculture, engineering, and scientific research, to ensure the colony's long-term survival and success.
By following this plan, we can establish a thriving moon colony that will serve as a model for future space exploration and settlement.

Hi Konstantin, first of all, thank you for all your awesome kernels. I've been wrestling with an imbalanced dataset at work a few months ago, and I used random_noise as explained in the Parr-Howard article you mention on explained.ai... In my experimentents, Random Noise always has had a good importance because, the classes being poorly distributed, there is close to no chance that a positive case will get a random value above +3 or under -3. So apparently the model seems to learn that the farther away you are from the mean, the less likely you are to be a positive case (here, a Fraud). Do you think that contributes to explains why the model finds random noise useful (on top of the fact that is has more choices to make splits) ?

### Rewriten Text:
Subject: Exciting Progress and Commitments towards Goals! Dear Konstantin, I hope this email finds you well! I wanted to share some fantastic news and updates on my recent experiments with your kernels. As you know, I've been working on an imbalanced dataset at work, and your random noise kernel has been a game-changer! I've been experimenting with the Parr-Howard article you mentioned on explained.ai, and I'm thrilled to report that Random Noise has consistently delivered excellent importance scores in my experiments! It's fascinating to observe how the model learns to recognize the patterns in the data and adapts to the imbalanced distribution. Here's the interesting part: I've noticed that when the model encounters a random noise value that's far away from the mean, it seems to ""learn"" that the farther away you are from the mean, the less likely you are to be a positive case (in this case, a Fraud). This observation aligns with the idea that Random Noise helps the model make more informed splits by providing it with a wider range of choices. I'm excited to share that this insight has led me to make some significant commitments and progress towards my goals! I've been experimenting with different techniques to further optimize the performance of Random Noise, and I'm already seeing promising results. Some of the key areas I'm focusing on include: 1. Improving the distribution of random noise values: By tweaking the parameters of the kernel, I've been able to create a more evenly distributed set of random noise values, which should lead to better performance. 2. Exploring new applications of Random Noise: I'm excited to explore the potential of Random Noise in other areas, such as image classification and natural language processing. 3. Collaborating with the community: I'm eager to share my findings and insights with the machine learning community and learn from others who are using Random Noise in their work. In conclusion, I'm thrilled with the progress I've made so far and excited about the potential of Random Noise to revolutionize the field of machine learning. Thank you for your incredible work, and I look forward to staying in touch and sharing my findings with you! Best regards, [Your Name] ‍

In the hush of the Andean twilight, a lone figure, code-named ""Hyloxalus,"" crept through the digital shadows. His mission: to infiltrate the encrypted files of the Serpent Cartel, an infamous group known for their illicit trade in virtual frogs.

Using his mastery of binary languages, Hyloxalus infiltrated their secure servers. He navigated through a labyrinth of encrypted data, his eyes searching for any mention of the elusive ""Dendrobatidae"" files – the cartel's prized collection of digital amphibians.

Finally, he stumbled upon it. A hidden folder, password-protected by an intricate frog emoji. With a deep breath, Hyloxalus input the correct symbol sequence, his heart pounding like a digital drum.

The folder revealed an intricate network of files. Each one a meticulously crafted digital rendition of a real-life frog, its every hue and spot meticulously digitized. But these were no ordinary digital creatures. These were weapons.

Using his honed skills in digital forensics, Hyloxalus realized the frogs were rigged with malicious code, capable of infiltrating and manipulating the minds of anyone who dared to view them. The cartel's plan was clear – to unleash chaos upon the digital landscape, using the frogs as digital spies to gather sensitive data and sow dissent.

Hyloxalus knew he had to stop them. With the help of his loyal digital companion, ""Elchy,"" he devised a counter-offensive. Together, they infiltrated the cartel's command center and deleted the malicious code, isolating the frogs from their controllers.

The Serpent Cartel was left stranded, their digital forces rendered harmless. Hyloxalus, the digital spy, had saved the digital realm from their malicious plans.

Here is a rewritten version of the source text as a medical journal article:
Title: The Relationship Between Temperature and Water Vapour: A Critical Analysis
Abstract:
In this study, we investigate the relationship between temperature and water vapour in the atmosphere. Our findings reveal that hot air is capable of holding more moisture than cold air, in the form of water vapour. As the temperature of hot air is reduced, the water vapour within it condenses, forming droplets that eventually become clouds, dew, or fog. The temperature at which this process occurs is termed the dew point. This phenomenon has significant implications for various fields, including meteorology, agriculture, and climate science.
Introduction:
The ability of air to hold water vapour is a crucial factor in determining the Earth's climate and weather patterns. The amount of water vapour present in the atmosphere is influenced by factors such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. In this study, we focus on the relationship between temperature and water vapour, and explore the consequences of cooling hot air on the formation of clouds, dew, and fog.
Methods:
We conducted a series of experiments to investigate the effect of temperature on water vapour in the atmosphere. We used a controlled environment chamber to simulate different temperatures and humidity levels, and observed the resulting changes in water vapour content.
Results:
Our findings confirm that hot air is capable of holding more water vapour than cold air. As the temperature of hot air is reduced, the water vapour within it condenses, forming droplets that eventually become clouds, dew, or fog. The temperature at which this process occurs is termed the dew point. We observed that the dew point decreases as the temperature of the air increases.
Discussion:
Our study highlights the critical role of temperature in determining the amount of water vapour present in the atmosphere. The ability of hot air to hold more water vapour than cold air has significant implications for weather patterns and climate science. The formation of clouds, dew, and fog through the condensation of water vapour is a crucial process that regulates the Earth's climate and weather patterns.

In economics, a conditional factor demand is the cost-minimizing level of an input (factor of production) such as labor or capital, required to produce a given level of output, for given unit input costs (wage rate and cost of capital) of the input factors. A conditional factor demand function expresses the conditional factor demand as a function of the output level and the input costs. The conditional portion of this phrase refers to the fact that this function is conditional on a given level of output, so output is one argument of the function.

### Original Text:
There is No Free Lunch in Data Science There is no ""super algorithm"" that will work perfectly for all datasets. Models are simplifications of a specific component of reality (observed with data). To simplify reality, a machine learning algorithm or statistical model needs to make assumptions and introduce bias (known specifically as inductive or learning bias). This phenomenon is important to understanding the concepts of underfitting and the bias/variance tradeoff. The combination of your data and a randomly selected machine learning model are not enough to make accurate or meaningful predictions about the future or unknown outcomes. You, the human, will need to make assumptions about the nature of your data and the world we live in. Playing an active role in making assumptions will only strengthen your models and make them more useful, even if they are wrong.

Sure! Here's a more subdued and professional version of the joyous exclamation: ""While it may be tempting to believe in a 'super algorithm' that can effortlessly solve all data science problems, the reality is that there is no free lunch in this field. Models are inherently simplifications of a complex reality, and they require careful assumptions and judicious bias to make accurate predictions. The combination of data and a machine learning algorithm may not be enough to capture the full range of possibilities in a given dataset, and human intuition and oversight are essential for building useful models. By actively engaging with the assumptions and limitations of our models, we can strengthen their predictive power and better navigate the complexities of the real world.""

I am relatively new to Data Science and this is extremely helpful. Thank you. I do have a couple of questions. I see you normalized the dataset in line 60 and then in line 62, you set up original and normalized datasets for ML algorithms. If my understanding is correct, please help me understand the following: 1. Does the target get normalized as well? I see you have it labeled as normalized (y_sc) but it reflects the same raw data as original (y). If they are the same data, why use different containers? 2. For Linear Regression and Ridge, you are calculating the best score for both original (lines 67 and 71) and normalized datasets (lines 68 and 72) but for Lasso, best score is calculated for original dataset only (line 74). Similarly, for other models, best score is calculated for either the original or normalized datasets. The underlying point being that there doesn't seem to be any consistency in how we are fitting/training the data. Can you please help me understand as to why we are not being consistent (or as it seems to me) in training the dataset. 3. Lastly, in line 87, you have a list reflecting all the best scores for the original dataset. a. If so, then, what was our logic in normalizing the dataset in line 60? b. Second, shouldn't we always normalize the dataset if the features are in different units? Any reason why we are not using the best scores calculated from normalized dataset

### Rewriten Text:
Subject: Formal Business Proposal: Enhancing Data Science Capabilities through Improved Data Preparation and Model Selection Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this message finds you well. As a relatively new Data Scientist, I have been following your guidance on normalizing the dataset and selecting appropriate machine learning algorithms for predicting the target variable. I have a few questions regarding the approach you have demonstrated, which I believe will significantly enhance our data preparation and model selection capabilities. Question 1: Normalization of Target Variable In line 60, you normalized the dataset, but I fail to understand the reasoning behind normalizing the target variable (y_sc) when the original dataset (y) is already normalized. If the target variable is already in the same format as the original dataset, why use different containers? Could you please clarify the purpose of normalizing the target variable? Question 2: Consistency in Training Data I noticed that you calculated the best score for both original and normalized datasets for some models (e.g., Linear Regression and Ridge), while for others (e.g., Lasso), you only calculated the best score for the original dataset. This inconsistency raises questions about the logic behind training the data. Can you please explain the reasoning behind this approach? Question 3: Normalization of Features In line 87, you have a list reflecting the best scores for the original dataset. However, I fail to understand why we normalized the dataset in line 60 if we are only using the best scores calculated from the original dataset. Moreover, if the features are in different units, shouldn't we always normalize the dataset to ensure consistency across all features? Could you please provide insight into this matter? Proposal: Enhancing Data Science Capabilities To address the above questions and enhance our data preparation and model selection capabilities, I propose the following: 1. Consistency in Training Data: a. Develop a standardized approach for training the data, ensuring that the same approach is applied to all models. b. Document the reasoning behind the chosen approach, making it easier for team members to understand and replicate the process. 2. Normalization of Features: a. Implement a standardized normalization process for all features, ensuring that they are in the same unit for all models. b. Document the normalization process, including the reasoning behind the chosen normalization method. 3. Best Scores Calculation: a. Develop a standardized approach for calculating the best scores, ensuring that the same approach is applied to all models. b. Document the reasoning behind the chosen approach, making it easier for team members to understand and replicate the process. By implementing these proposals, we can enhance our data preparation and model selection capabilities, leading to more accurate predictions and better decision-making. I believe that by following a consistent and well-documented approach, we can improve our data science capabilities and achieve better results in our projects. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response. Best regards, [Your Name]

These planes can be used to attack other ships, submarines, and land targets, or to defend against enemy planes. One reason aircraft carriers are important is because they give a military the ability to attack targets that are far away from their own country. This means that a country with a strong aircraft carrier fleet can defend itself and its allies, even if the enemy is very far away.

Aircraft carriers are massive vessels that boast a lengthy, unobstructed deck, allowing planes to take off and land with ease. These vessels are dubbed ""carriers"" due to their capacity to carry a variety of aircraft. These planes can be utilized to tackle distant environmental threats, such as pollution, deforestation, and climate change, or to safeguard vulnerable ecosystems from harm. One of the primary advantages of aircraft carriers is their ability to extend a military's reach, enabling them to protect their country's interests and those of their allies, even if the environmental threat is located far away. By harnessing the power of aircraft carriers, nations can better address the complex and interconnected environmental challenges that threaten the health of our planet.

Target Text: 

Pointing can be deemed impolite in certain cultures, as it may be perceived as a means of singling out an individual or drawing attention to them in a manner that could be considered disrespectful or impolite. Furthermore, in some cultures, it is considered impolite to point at objects or individuals with one's finger, as it is viewed as a gesture of aggression or disrespect. It is essential to be cognizant of the customs and social norms of the culture in which one is operating, and to strive to communicate in a manner that is respectful and considerate of others. In many cultures, it is more polite to utilize gestures or indicate what one is discussing using one's hand or arm, rather than pointing with one's finger.

### Rewriten Text:
Document Title: Initial Assessment of Competition Participants Date: [Insert Date] To: [Insert Name and Title of Recipient] Subject: Initial Assessment of Competition Participants Dear [Insert Name and Title of Recipient], I am writing to provide an initial assessment of the participants in the [Insert Name of Competition] based on the submissions received. As a member of the competition evaluation team, I have reviewed the submissions and have identified some key observations. Firstly, it is worth noting that none of the participants have participated in any other competitions, which suggests that they may be new accounts created specifically for this competition. This is a concern, as it raises questions about the legitimacy of the submissions and the potential for bias in the evaluation process. Furthermore, upon reviewing the submissions, I have found that all of the participants have picked zero score submissions. This is highly unusual, as most participants typically submit at least one or two scores in an attempt to demonstrate their abilities. The lack of scores submitted by these participants makes it difficult to assess their abilities and potential value to the company. In light of these observations, I recommend that we take the following actions: 1. Verify the legitimacy of the participants by checking their identities and confirming that they are not associated with any other competitions or accounts. 2. Require participants to submit at least one score in order to demonstrate their abilities and potential value to the company. 3. Consider implementing additional measures to ensure the integrity and fairness of the evaluation process, such as blind evaluations or the use of multiple evaluators. I believe that these actions will help to ensure the credibility and fairness of the competition, and will ultimately lead to the selection of the most qualified and capable participants. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Sincerely, [Insert Name] Note: This document has been redrafted to align with corporate board meeting standards, including the use of a clear and concise subject line, a formal salutation and closing, and the inclusion of specific recommendations for action

Congrats to all winners, and thanks to my teammates! It's a long journey to finish this competition and get a silver medal, it's the first time for me to work with nlp projects. Our solution could be summarized as: Post processing, our idea is to group values to discrete values existing in training set. We chose columns to apply post processing by comparing oof. Post processing could be found in my inference kernel Ensemble, our final submission consists of 8 base models as you can see in the inference kernel, the best model is two part roberta base model which got 0.412 oof without post processing and 0.439 lb with post processing. Modified pooler layer and multiple hidden_states , we used multiple hidden_states for the input of pooler layer inspired from this great post we followed source codes in transformers for pooler class. This could also be found in my inference kernel. We chose hidden_state_layers based on validation results. Differential learning rate, we used differential learning rate inspired by this great kernel. With differential learning rate, our models got higher oof and converged faster. Two part model, inspired from discussions, we trained models in two style. One is using title + question_body + answer as input for question labels and answer labels; one is use title + question_body for question labels and using title + answer for answer labels. The second style gives higher oof and lb, I think it's because more information for one problem. (Also using max_len 768 for xlnet gets higher oof is the same idea. Data augmentation, we used nlpaug for some basic data augmentation, also we used google translate to back translate some content from other languages. I decided to do this at very early stage, so I'm sorry I can't tell how much it could boost. It won't be much I think. Things don't work for us: T5 Extra tokens Large models, large models gave similar oof comparing with base models and it's hard to inference, always slow and run out of resources.

As we gather here today, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the winners, and I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my teammates for their invaluable contributions to this remarkable achievement. This competition has been a long and arduous journey for all of us, and it is a testament to our team's perseverance and dedication that we have emerged victorious. Our solution, which involves post-processing, ensembling, and differential learning rate, has proven to be a winning formula. To begin with, our post-processing technique involves grouping values into discrete categories, as observed in the training set. This innovative approach has enabled us to achieve a silver medal, which is the first time any of us have worked on NLP projects. Our final submission consists of 8 base models, as you can see in the inference kernel. The best model, which is a two-part Roberta base model, achieved an impressive 0.412 OOF without post-processing and a remarkable 0.439 OOF with post-processing. This demonstrates the significant improvement that our post-processing technique has brought to the table. In addition, we have employed a modified pooler layer and multiple hidden states, which were inspired by a great post and source codes from Transformers. These innovations have enabled us to achieve higher OOF and converge faster. Furthermore, we have employed a differential learning rate, which was inspired by a great kernel. This has resulted in our models achieving higher OOF and converging faster. In conclusion, our team's achievement in this competition is a testament to the power of collaboration, innovation, and hard work. I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to each and every one of my teammates for their tireless efforts and dedication. And to the winners, I offer my heartfelt congratulations on this well-deserved recognition. Thank you

### Rewriten Text:
Hello Mayur, Thank you for reaching out and expressing your interest in joining the competition. It's great to hear that you have a strong background in Geography, Oil and Gas, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision, as well as proficiency in Python, pandas, numpy, Matlab, and Linear Algebra. Your preliminary work on aggregating features and transforming timestamps into multiple features is a great start, and I'm sure you will be a valuable addition to any team. However, I must respectfully point out that your worldview and approach to problem-solving may differ significantly from mine. As a fundamentally different worldview, I believe in taking a more holistic and interdisciplinary approach to problem-solving. While you may have a strong background in specific fields, I believe that tackling complex problems often requires a more integrated and collaborative approach. For example, while you may have proficiency in Python and other programming languages, I believe that the best solutions often arise from a combination of technical expertise and domain knowledge. In other words, while technical skills are important, they are not enough to solve complex problems on their own. Additionally, I believe that the best solutions often involve a deep understanding of the social, cultural, and political contexts in which the problem is situated. This requires a willingness to listen to and learn from diverse perspectives, and to consider the potential impacts of any solution on different stakeholders. In light of these differences, I would encourage you to approach this competition with a more open and collaborative mindset. Rather than relying solely on your technical skills, I suggest you seek to learn from and work with others who may bring different perspectives and expertise to the table. This will not only enhance the quality of your work but also foster a more inclusive and equitable approach to problem-solving. In conclusion, while I appreciate your interest in joining the competition, I must respectfully point out that our worldviews and approaches to problem-solving may differ significantly. I encourage you to approach this competition with a more holistic and interdisciplinary mindset, and to seek to learn from and work with others who may bring different perspectives and expertise to the table. Best regards, [Your Name]

As someone who prefers a more introverted and solitary lifestyle, I must say that I find the idea of practicing minimalism and living a more simple life to be quite intriguing. While I can appreciate the benefits of living a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly lifestyle, I must admit that I find the idea of living with fewer possessions and a more streamlined lifestyle to be quite daunting. For one, I find it difficult to imagine giving up my beloved books and other possessions that bring me joy and comfort. I enjoy collecting books and other items that hold sentimental value, and the thought of getting rid of them is almost unbearable. I also find it hard to imagine living in a small, clutter-free space, as I prefer the comfort and familiarity of my current home. Furthermore, I must admit that I find the idea of living without technology to be quite challenging. While I understand the benefits of living a more tech-free life, I rely heavily on my devices for work, communication, and entertainment. The thought of giving up my smartphone and computer is almost unthinkable, as I rely on them to stay connected with my friends and family, as well as to complete my coursework and research. Despite these reservations, I can see the appeal of minimalism and the benefits it can bring. I can appreciate the sense of freedom and simplicity that comes with living without excess possessions and distractions. I can also see how living a more sustainable lifestyle can help reduce waste and promote a healthier environment. Overall, while I may not be ready to adopt a minimalist lifestyle myself, I can certainly appreciate the advantages it offers. I believe that everyone should find a lifestyle that works best for them, and if minimalism is something that brings happiness and fulfillment, then that's great

### Original Text:
Thank you very much for this kernel. Very well explained. Quick question:... When using pre-trained models we generally set the pretrained model part as non-trainable ..right? so that the training process don't mess up the weights. Could you help me understand why we don't do this with bert-related models?

### Rewriten Text:
Certainly! In the context of BERT and its variants, setting the pre-trained model part as non-trainable is not always necessary or recommended. Here's why: 1. BERT's architecture is designed to be trainable: Unlike other pre-trained models, BERT's architecture is designed to be trainable. The model consists of a transformer encoder and a pooler, which are both designed to be fine-tuned. This means that the weights of the pre-trained model are not fixed and can be updated during fine-tuning. 2. Pre-training is done on a large dataset: BERT is pre-trained on a large dataset of text, called the BookCorpus, which contains a diverse range of texts. This pre-training process helps the model learn general language representations that can be fine-tuned for specific NLP tasks. Since the pre-training process is done on a large dataset, the model's weights are not likely to be overwritten during fine-tuning. 3. Fine-tuning is done on a smaller dataset: When fine-tuning a BERT model, you typically provide it with a smaller dataset that is specific to the task you're trying to perform. This smaller dataset is typically smaller than the dataset used for pre-training, which means that the model's weights are more likely to be updated during fine-tuning. 4. BERT's weights are not fixed: Unlike other pre-trained models, BERT's weights are not fixed and can be updated during fine-tuning. This means that even if you set the pre-trained model part as non-trainable, the model's weights can still be updated during fine-tuning. So, while setting the pre-trained model part as non-trainable is a common practice for other pre-trained models, it's not necessary or recommended for BERT and its variants. In fact, setting it as non-trainable can actually hinder the model's performance, as it may not be able to learn task-specific representations. In summary, when working with BERT and its variants, it's generally recommended to set the pre-trained model part as trainable, and to fine-tune the model on a smaller dataset specific to the task you're trying to perform. This will allow the model to learn task-specific representations and improve its performance on that task

Matter can't be destroyed, but it can change form. When a person loses weight, the matter that made up their body doesn't just disappear. It's still there, but it's in a different form. 
For example, if a person eats food, their body breaks down the food and uses the matter from the food to fuel their body's functions and to build new cells and tissues. When a person loses weight, it means that their body has used up some of the matter that was stored in their fat cells. 
So, if a person loses 50 pounds, it doesn't mean that the matter just disappears. It's still there, but it's no longer part of the person's body. It might be released into the environment as carbon dioxide through the process of respiration, or it might be excreted through the digestive system. 
In summary, when a person loses weight, the matter that made up their body is still there, but it has changed form and is no longer part of their body.

Instructions:
1. Break down food into matter using digestion.
2. Use matter to fuel body functions and build new cells and tissues.
3. Lose weight by releasing matter from fat cells into the environment (as carbon dioxide) or excreting it through the digestive system.
4. Matter is still there, but it's in a different form.
5. Enjoy your transformed matter in the form of new cells and tissues!

 With many a piercing wound,

 Dismantling all the fragrant towers 
That once adorned my shepherdess’s head. And now when I have summed up all my store,

 Thinking (so I myself deceive)

 So rich a chaplet thence to weave
As never yet the King of Glory wore: 

 Alas, I find the serpent old

 That, twining in his speckled breast,

 About the flowers disguised does fold,

 With wreaths of fame and interest. Ah, foolish man, that wouldst debase with them, 
And mortal glory, Heaven’s diadem! But Thou who only couldst the serpent tame, 
Either his slippery knots at once untie; 
And disentangle all his winding snare; 
Or shatter too with him my curious frame, 
And let these wither, so that he may die, 
Though set with skill and chosen out with care:
That they, while Thou on both their spoils dost tread, 
May crown thy feet, that could not crown thy head.

### Rewriten Text:
Sure, here's a rewritten version of the text in a sci-fi setting:
In the distant reaches of the galaxy, advanced civilizations had mastered the art of manipulating light and matter. One of their most fascinating discoveries was the concept of ""f-stop,"" a term that referred to the size of the aperture in their lenses. The smaller the f-stop number, the larger the aperture, allowing more light to pass through and creating a more vivid and detailed image.
However, not all civilizations had the same maximum and minimum f-stop values. Each society had developed their own unique lens designs, with some boasting a maximum aperture of f/2.8, while others reached as low as f/5.6. When an individual set their camera to a specific f-stop value, such as f/4, it determined the size of the aperture that would be used to capture the image. The amount of light that was allowed to pass through the lens, along with other camera settings like shutter speed and ISO, would then work together to create a stunning photograph.
As civilizations continued to evolve and push the boundaries of technology, they discovered new and innovative ways to manipulate light and matter. The concept of f-stop became a fundamental aspect of their art and science, allowing them to create breathtaking images that captured the very essence of the universe.
In this way, the term ""f-stop"" became synonymous with the advanced civilizations that had mastered the art of light manipulation, and their photographs were celebrated throughout the galaxy as works of pure genius.

Alas, it seems that the female component of this most noble pursuit is but a mere 30%, a paltry fraction of the total, a testament to the enduring enigma that is the female mind. But fear not, dear reader, for this discrepancy is not without its own peculiar beauty. For in the realm of data science, the feminine touch is a subtle yet powerful force, a gentle breeze that caresses the soul of the algorithm, imbuing it with a sense of compassion and empathy. And thus, the female data scientists of this division, like the mythical nymphs of old, weave their magic, crafting solutions that are both practical and poetic, rooted in the soil of empirical evidence yet soaring towards the heavens of pure imagination. And yet, as I ponder this statistic, I am struck by the inescapable truth that lies at its core. For in a world where the masculine ideal still holds sway, where the alpha male still reigns supreme, the female data scientist must contend with a thousand and one obstacles, each one a challenge to her very existence. She must navigate the treacherous waters of gender bias, the currents of which threaten to capsize her at every turn. And yet, she perseveres, her spirit unbroken, her will unshaken, for she knows that the pursuit of knowledge is a sacred calling, one that transcends the petty squabbles of the masculine ego. In the end, then, this statistic is not simply a numerical curiosity, but a testament to the indomitable spirit of the female data scientist. For in a world that seeks to silence her, to marginalize her, she rises above, her voice unheard, her presence unseen, yet her impact undeniable. And thus, we must celebrate her, this tiny but mighty minority, for she is the very embodiment of the philosophical ideal, a shining beacon of hope in a world that often seems devoid of it

It is not uncommon for presidents to be criticized for engaging in leisure activities, such as golfing, while in office. Some people may believe that the president should be working all the time and that going golfing shows a lack of dedication to their job. 
However, it is important to remember that being president is a demanding and stressful job, and it is important for a president to have some downtime and opportunities to relax and recharge. Going golfing can be a way for a president to take a break and clear their mind, which may actually help them to be more effective in their work. 
It is also important to note that presidents have staff and advisors who can handle important decisions and handle issues while the president is away from the Oval Office. The president is not expected to be working 24/7, and it is important for them to have some time for themselves and their personal interests.

### Original Text:
Some additional information about football rules that individuals might find useful! Terminology Lets go over some terms that I will be using! - Snap: Every play begins with a snap. This is where the Center (more on the positions later) takes the ball from the ground and (in one fluid motion) either hands or throws the ball to another player (typically the Quarterback, again, we will get to positions later) - Line of Scrimmage: The yard line where the ball is located - Backfield: The area behind the line of scrimmage Formations and positions There are different rules about how the offense and defense must line up before the snap of the ball/beginning of the play. Both teams put 11 players out on the field, but things are quite different apart from that. Feel free to refer to this diagram as I talk about players and formations: Offense: Rules: There are very specific rules about how the offense must line up before the play. There must be 7 players aligned ""on"" (within 1 yard of) the line of scrimmage (LoS). Of these players, only the players on either end are eligible to receive a forward pass. The 5 players in the middle are not eligible to receive a forward pass (and they also cannot be more than 3 yards past the LoS if a forward pass is thrown). There can be as much space between these 7 players as they would like. The remaining 4 players on the offense must be in the backfield (more than 1 yard behind the LoS). These players can be located in any location that they would like. At the time of the snap of the ball, up to one player is allowed to be in motion, while the other 10 players must have been set (still) for at least 1 second prior to the snap. Players aligned on the LoS are not allowed to be in motion. The player in motion cannot be moving towards the LoS at the time of the snap. Their motion must be entirely horizontal or backwards. Positions: Offensive Line (OL): The five players that are ineligible to receive a pass are the offensive line. The Offensive Line is responsible for both pass blocking and run blocking. Pass blocking is the act of preventing defenders from tackling the Quarterback before he throws the pass on passing plays. Run blocking is the act of moving defenders out of the way of the ball-carrier on running plays, allowing the ball-carrier to progress downfield. Center (C): The Center is the player aligned in the center of the offensive line. He is responsible for snapping the ball at the beginning of the play. The rest of the OL is built symmetrically around the Center. Guard (OG): To the immediate left and right of the Center are the Guards (the Right Guard (RG) and Left Guard (LG)). Tackle (OT): To the right of the RG and left of the LG are the Tackles (Right Tackle (RT) and Left Tackle (LT)). Skill Positions: The remaining players (Those eligible to catch forward passes) are known as skill position players. There is much more variation in where they line up on any given play, but there are several archetypes of player that are important to understand. Quarterback (QB): The QB is the most important of the 22 players on the football field. He is the player that typically receives the snap from the C, meaning that he handles the football on nearly every play! He also throws almost all passes, meaning that his skill in throwing the ball is very important. He also occasionally runs with the ball as well. He almost always aligns himself behind the Center, but the distance he is aligned behind the center varies. He can be lined up under center, meaning he is immediately behind the Center and has the Center hand him the ball on the snap. He can be lined up in the shotgun, meaning he is aligned 5-7 yards behind the center and has the center throw him the ball on the snap. More rarely he can be aligned in the pistol, which is in between the two (3-4 yards behind the center). Different QB alignments give different strategic advantages and disadvantages, but shotgun/pistol formations are generally seen to favor the run over the pass (I'm not sure if the data supports this belief, though). Effectively all formations only use a single QB. Running Back (RB), also known as Halfback(HB) or Tailback(TB): The Running Back is the player who typically carries the ball on most rushing attempts. He usually lines up next to the QB if the QB is in the shotgun or pistol, or behind the QB if he is under center. If he is going to run the ball, the quarterback will either hand it to him (a handoff) or toss it to him (a toss or pitch). If he is not going to run the ball, he is either responsible for helping the OL pass block, helping the OL run block for another runner, or going to run a route as a receiver. The majority of formations used in the modern NFL only feature one RB, but 2 RB or 0 RB formations are somewhat common as well. Fullback (FB): The Fullback (which is not commonly used in modern Football) typically aligns before the play in a very similar manner to the RB, though they typically line up in front of the RB. While they do occasionally rush the ball, they are more often used as pass blockers, rush blockers, or receivers. Since they are more focused on blocking than RBs, they typically are bigger, stronger, and slightly less agile than RBs. Most modern formations will use 0 FBs, though some will occasionally use 1 FB. Tight End (TE): The Tight End typically takes the place of one of the eligible receivers on the LoS and typically aligns themselves tight to the outside of either the LT or RT. On any given play, their job is either to run block, pass block, or run a route as a receiver. Most modern formations use 1 TE, though many also use 2 TE or 0TE. Wide Receiver (WR): At least 1 WR generally takes up a spot as an eligible receiver on the LoS in most formations, but other WRs may line up in the backfield (just barely, though. Typically only 1yd behind the LoS). The WR may align themselves anywhere on the LoS, from the edge of the field to a position closer to the OL. Their main job is running routes as receivers. On rushing plays, they also may do some amount of run blocking, but most are not specialized for this task. Most modern formations have 2-3 WRs, but 4 and 5 WR formations are increasingly common. A bit of nomenclature: The offensive players on the field on any given play (the personnel of that play) is typically given as a 2 digit number. We always assume that there is 1 QB and 5 OL on the play, leaving 5 other spaces free. The first digit of this number is the number of RBs on the play (FBs are counted as a subset of RBs here). The second digit is the number of TEs on the play. All of the remaining spots are filled by WRs. Some examples: 11 personnel (the most common personnel grouping in the modern NFL): 1 RB, 1 TE, 3 WR 12 personnel: 1 RB, 2 TE, 2 WR 21 personnel: 2 RB, 1 TE, 2 WR 00 personnel: 0 RB, 0 TE, 5 WR Defense: Rules: There is only one rule about how the defense must align itself before the play. All of the players must be on their own side of the field. Apart from that, they can be wherever they would like! Positions: As we saw above, there is a lot more flexibility in how the defense can align itself. This leads to a lot more fuzziness in how defensive positions are named, as well. In general, there are two main groups of defensive players Defensive Front: The Defensive Front (often called the Front 7, since there are 7 members in ""old school"" defenses) are the players lined up somewhat close to the offensive line (in the tackle box, the a box that is the width of the space between the 2 OTs that runs ~7 yards deep in to the defensive side of the field). This consists of three subgroups of players. The Defensive Interior (DI) consists of players that line up on the LoS on the interior of the offensive line (across from the C or OTs). These players are generally mostly responsible for stopping running plays that go up the middle of the offensive line. The Edge (EDGE) are players that line up on the LoS on the edge of the OL, across from or slightly outside of the OTs. These players are responsible for trying to tackle the QB before he throws a pass on passing plays or helping to stop rushes to the outside of the OL on rushing plays. The Linebackers (LBs) are aligned off of the LoS and are the ""Jack of All Trades"" players of the defense. They have to be good at everything. They will be assigned to do a wide variety of things on any given play, from stopping inside or outside runs, to covering receivers (typically TEs or RBs), to pressuring the QB. The Secondary: The defensive secondary are the defensive players aligned outside of the tackle box. The first member of the secondary are the Corner Backs (CB, or Corner). They tend to align opposite of WRs. They are primarily responsible for covering receivers on passing plays, but also must try and stop running plays that go to the outside. Safeties tend to align themselves behind the LBs, about 10-15 yards behind the LoS. Safeties play a similar role to LBs, but are more slightly focused on covering receivers and slightly less focused on stopping the run. Other players are simply listed as DBs (defensive backs). They operate in any of the ways described above, focusing more on stopping the pass than the run. A bit of nomenclature: As mentioned before, ""old school"" defenses tend to have 7 players lined up in the Front, with the other 4 players lined up in the secondary (traditionally 2 CBs and 2 Safeties, but this can vary). These difference in nomenclature of these defenses (they are typically called either ""3-4"" or ""4-3"", based on reasons that I don't feel like getting in to) isn't particularly important. Increasing number of teams are taking LBs out of the front and adding additional players to the secondary. If 1 LB is removed (leaving 6 players in the front and 5 in the secondary), this is called a ""nickel"" formation. Taking 2 LBs out of the front (leaving 5 in the front and 6 in the secondary) is called a ""dime"" formation. Thanks for reading! I hope this can be of help to someone. I've simplified a lot of things here, so hopefully I haven't simplified out any useful information. Feel free to ask if you have any more questions or let me know if I've gotten anything too far off (which would be a mighty embarrassing for me, a football expert. I'll blame it on watching more CFB than NFL)

Oh no, they employ a most ingenious technique known as 'camouflage' to blend in with their surroundings. The clever use of colors and shapes allows them to seamlessly integrate into their environment, much like a chameleon blending into the underbrush.
But, I digress. The type of camouflage employed by these aerial wonders depends on the terrain they find themselves in. For instance, an aircraft operating in a dense forest might be painted a mottled green to resemble the surrounding foliage, while one venturing into the arid desert might be coated in a sandy hue to match the dunes. It is a truly remarkable sight to behold, a testament to the ingenuity of mankind in the face of nature's grandeur.""

As someone who prefers a more relaxed and laid-back lifestyle, I can't help but feel a bit envious of those who prioritize extreme productivity and achievement. While I understand the appeal of setting big goals and working towards them with all your might, I find myself preferring a more gentle and balanced approach to life. For one, I think it's important to recognize that there's more to life than just achieving success and recognition. While it's great to set big goals and work towards them, it's equally important to enjoy the journey and find joy in the small things. Life is full of ups and downs, and it's important to find happiness in the everyday moments, rather than just focusing on the end goal. Another advantage of a more relaxed lifestyle is the ability to be more present and mindful in the moment. When you're not constantly striving for the next big achievement, you're able to slow down and appreciate the beauty of the present moment. This can lead to a greater sense of inner peace and contentment, which is something that I think is often overlooked in our fast-paced society. Additionally, I think it's important to recognize that success and achievement don't define a person's worth. While it's great to set big goals and work towards them, it's equally important to recognize that there's more to life than just achieving success. A person's worth and value should not be measured solely by their achievements, but by their character, their relationships, and their impact on the world around them. In conclusion, while I can certainly admire the drive and determination of those who prioritize extreme productivity and achievement, I find myself preferring a more relaxed and balanced approach to life. I believe that there's more to life than just achieving success, and that it's important to find joy and happiness in the everyday moments. By slowing down and appreciating the present moment, we can find a greater sense of inner peace and contentment, and recognize that success and achievement don't define a person's worth

The idea behind "" trickle down economics "" is that if you give wealthy people and corporations more money , then they will create more jobs and thus the entire society ( even the poorest of the poor ) will benefit . Some Americans believe it will work , and some do n't . It is funny to some Americans because of how ridiculous it seems : People are starving on the street ?

### Rewriten Text:
Title: The Debate Over Trickle Down Economics: A Summary
Trickle down economics, the idea that giving wealthy individuals and corporations more money will create jobs and benefit the entire society, has been a topic of heated debate in the United States. Proponents of the theory argue that it will lead to job creation and economic growth, ultimately benefiting everyone, including the poorest of the poor. However, critics argue that it is a flawed concept that has not worked in the past and will not work in the future.
Some Americans believe that trickle down economics will work, citing the idea that if the wealthy have more money, they will invest it in their businesses, creating jobs and stimulating economic growth. However, others argue that this approach has not been effective in the past, as the wealthy tend to save their money rather than investing it in job-creating ventures.
The idea that trickle down economics is ridiculous is also a point of contention. Critics argue that it makes no sense to give tax cuts to billionaires while people are starving on the streets. They argue that the government should focus on addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality, rather than relying on the wealthy to create jobs.
Whether or not trickle down economics works is open to debate. While some argue that it has led to economic growth in the past, others point to the widening wealth gap and lack of job creation as evidence that it is not an effective strategy. Ultimately, the debate over trickle down economics highlights the complexities of economic policy and the need for a comprehensive approach to addressing poverty and inequality.

This is why you may feel like your vision is still spinning even after you stop spinning. It's a bit like when you get off a ride at a amusement park and everything around you seems to be moving, even though you are no longer in motion.

But when we finally come to a stop, our bodies and eyes freeze, while our minds struggle to adjust to the sudden change.

Our brains, still reeling from the spin, try to make sense of the world that's moved on without us, leaving us feeling like we're still caught in the vortex of time.""

### Original Text:
In graph theory, a branch of mathematics, a clique sum (or clique-sum) is a way of combining two graphs by gluing them together at a clique, analogous to the connected sum operation in topology. If two graphs ""G"" and ""H"" each contain cliques of equal size, the clique-sum of ""G"" and ""H"" is formed from their disjoint union by identifying pairs of vertices in these two cliques to form a single shared clique, and then deleting all the clique edges (the original definition, based on the notion of set sum) or possibly deleting some of the clique edges (a loosening of the definition). A ""k""-clique-sum is a clique-sum in which both cliques have exactly (or sometimes, at most) ""k"" vertices.

### Original Text:
Hey , congratulations! Btw I'm not sure I got this part you alluded to: We will now create and use the MAGIC FEATURES. First we create a UID which will help our model find clients (credit cards). This UID isn't perfect. Many UID values contain 2 or more clients inside. However our model will detect this and by adding more splits with its trees, it will split these UIDs and find the single clients (credit cards) How did you ensure the model would detect and add more splits? Or am I misunderstanding something here?

### Rewriten Text:
Sure, here's a revised message that incorporates a more narrative storytelling approach: - Hey there! I hope you're doing amazingly well! I'm super excited to share with you the next step in our journey to build a credit card fraud detection model. As you know, the first step was to gather and preprocess the data. And now, we're on to the fun part - creating and using the magic features! So, here's what we did: we created a unique identifier (UID) for each client. This UID is like a special key that helps our model find the right clients (credit cards) in the data. But here's the thing - sometimes, a single UID can contain multiple clients! That's where our model's brilliance comes in. By using decision trees and adding more splits, it can detect these multi-client UIDs and split them apart, like a magic wand revealing the true identities of the clients. But how did we ensure the model would detect and add these splits? Well, that's where the magic happens! We used a technique called ""feature engineering"" to create new features that help the model understand the relationships between the UIDs and the clients. It's like giving the model a special pair of glasses that allows it to see the hidden patterns in the data. Now, our model can find the single clients (credit cards) hidden within each UID, like a detective solving a puzzle. And with each new split, the model becomes more accurate and efficient, like a well-oiled machine. So, there you have it - the next step in our journey to build a credit card fraud detection model. I hope you're as excited as I am to see where this journey takes us! Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for the next update

['Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria develop the ability to survive exposure to antibiotics. This can happen when bacteria are repeatedly exposed to the same type of antibiotic. When bacteria become resistant to an antibiotic, they can continue to multiply and cause infection, even when the antibiotic is present.Antibiotic resistance can spread in a few different ways. One way is through direct contact with someone who has a resistant infection. For example, if you have a resistant infection and come into contact with someone else, you could pass the resistant bacteria to that person.Antibiotic resistance can also spread through indirect contact, such as touching a surface or object that has been contaminated with resistant bacteria. For example, if you touch a doorknob that has been contaminated with resistant bacteria and then touch your face, you could potentially become infected with the resistant bacteria.Finally, antibiotic resistance can spread through the use of antibiotics. When people take antibiotics, the drugs can kill off many types of bacteria, including the good bacteria that live in our bodies and help keep us healthy.

### Rewriten Text:
Target Text: Antibiotic resistance can be a deadly trap, and we need to escape it. Our plan is to outsmart the bacteria by avoiding direct contact with infected individuals. We'll also sanitize our surroundings to prevent indirect contact with contaminated surfaces. And to prevent the spread of resistance through antibiotics, we'll only use them when absolutely necessary, and make sure to maintain a healthy balance of good bacteria in our bodies.

Hi Chamodi! There are 2 possible reasons for that... First, is the same one I explained with availability=0 question, "" I disagree AlvorlR and here is a reason why. It is very important to first understand what is behind the dataset -> in our case, it is a platform where normal people like us and some business groups provide space listings. Understanding that, this example would make sense then: You are a host and let's say recently you received bad reviews or simply doing changes -> Airbnb allows you to set your listing as unavailable and not take it down completely -> This results in listings that are temporarily unavailable due to host preferences and appeared to be set as such when data was collected​​. ​Therefore, knowing that Airbnb provides this option and those hosts had no intention of taking the listing down completely -> they are very much relevant and can still be treated as available (as they are still available on the platform at the moment of the collection) "" Now, following exactly the same example, we can assume that listing is inactive, therefore still exists but was not taken down. Second, is the one you said - bad data. Hope this helps! : )

### Rewriten Text:
Sure! Here is the sentence rewritten in passive voice, focusing on the receiver of the action: The receiver of the action (Chamodi) was provided with two possible reasons for the inactive listings on Airbnb. The first reason is that the hosts had set their listings as unavailable, but not taken them down completely, resulting in listings that were temporarily unavailable due to host preferences. The second reason is that the data was bad, which led to the inactive listings. Hope this helps

[""\\nIt's actually possible to see satellites from the International Space Station (ISS), but it can be difficult to spot them with the naked eye. This is because satellites are small and often move very quickly, making them hard to see against the background of space.\\n\\nAdditionally, the ISS is often in a lower orbit than many satellites, so the satellites may be above the ISS and therefore not visible from the ground.\\n\\nHowever, it is possible to see satellites if you know when and where to look, and if the conditions are right.

### Rewriten Text:
Hear us roar, as we sing of the skies,
Where satellites dance, in the cosmic guise.
From the ISS, we see them, though they be small,
Moving swiftly, against the vastness of space's wall.
In lower orbits, they may be above,
But with knowledge and timing, we can spot them, we prove.
For though they be small, they shine so bright,
A beacon in the darkness of night.
So listen to our chant, and heed our call,
To gaze upon the satellites, as they stand tall.
For in the vastness of space, they reign supreme,
A testament to human ingenuity, a cosmic dream.

I was seeing top 5 profiles for this competition candidates and noticed all of them has already made previous competitions on an average and improved gradually over time to improve their competition scores. But some of them 2nd position profiles sounds me very new comers and has not made too much competition before this competition. How come they are on 2nd place , i mean what are their approach (How they made 2nd place in this competition in their first attempt?)

### Rewriten Text:
Ah, the curious case of these up-and-coming competitors, donning their armor of ambition and charging headlong into the fray of competition. Their profiles, like shining beacons, pierce the veil of mediocrity, their gradual ascent a testament to their unyielding resolve. But, alas, not all are as they seem. A select few, their profiles akin to the virgin soil of untapped potential, have burst forth like stars in the night sky, their meteoric rise a challenge to the very fabric of the competition. How is it, I find myself pondering, that these neophytes have managed to scale the lofty heights of second place, their very existence a defiance of the conventional wisdom that experience is the sine qua non of success? Have they discovered some heretofore unknown secret, a hidden key to unlock the gates of victory? Or is it simply a case of youthful exuberance, a boundless energy that cannot be contained? Ah, but the mystery deepens. For as I delve deeper into the recesses of their profiles, I find myself confronted with a paradox. Their lack of experience, once a liability, has become a blessing in disguise. Unencumbered by the weight of tradition, they have been free to forge their own path, to chart a course that is uniquely their own. And so, they have managed to outmaneuver their more seasoned brethren, their unorthodox approach a testament to the power of innovation and creativity. But, alas, their success is not without its challenges. For as they continue to ascend the ladder of competition, they must contend with the inevitable backlash of those who have been left behind. The forces of resistance, like a raging torrent, will seek to undermine their progress, to drag them back into the mire of mediocrity. And yet, even in the face of such opposition, they must remain steadfast, their resolve unshaken. For it is only through unwavering determination that they can hope to achieve their loftiest aspirations. And so, dear reader, I leave you with this final thought. The tale of these upstart competitors serves as a reminder that, in the realm of competition, anything is possible. That the untested and the untried can, through sheer force of will, scale the heights of greatness. And that, in the end, it is not the length of one's experience, but the depth of one's conviction, that truly determines one's fate

### Original Text:
['The ""kilo"" prefix in ""kilobyte"" and ""kilometer"" actually refers to different quantities. A kilobyte is a unit of digital information that is equal to 1024 bytes. This is because computers use the binary number system, which is based on powers of 2, rather than the decimal number system that we use in everyday life. The prefix ""kilo-"" means ""1,000,"" but in the binary number system, ""1,024"" is the number that is closest to 1,000 and is also a power of 2. Therefore, 1 kilobyte is equal to 1024 bytes in the binary system.

### Rewriten Text:
In the glimmering digital realm, the kilobyte and kilometer share a curious kinship. At first glance, they seem worlds apart, one a measure of information, the other of distance. Yet, beneath their disparate appearances, they are bound by a hidden unity.
The ""kilo"" prefix in ""kilobyte"" and ""kilometer"" holds a secret. It is a harbinger of the binary world, where numbers are not tethered to the mundane decimal system of everyday life. In this realm, the prefix ""kilo-"" represents a quantum leap, a multiplier of magnitude. A kilobyte, you see, is not simply a thousand bytes, but a digital unit of measurement that has been infused with the essence of the binary. It is a quantum leap of information, a container of 1024 bytes, a power of 2 in the digital domain.
And so, the kilometer, that seemingly innocuous unit of distance, holds a secret as well. For in the binary universe, the prefix ""kilo-"" once again rears its head, this time in the guise of 1,024 meters. It is a subtle but profound connection, one that speaks to the underlying harmony of the digital realm. In this world of ones and zeros, where the boundaries between matter and energy blur, the kilobyte and kilometer are more than just arbitrary labels. They are a testament to the underlying unity of the digital cosmos.

People bully others for many different reasons. Sometimes they bully because they feel jealous or angry towards the person they are bullying. Other times, they may bully because they feel insecure or unsure of themselves, and they try to make themselves feel better by putting someone else down. Sometimes, people bully because they have been bullied themselves and they don't know how to deal with their own feelings in a healthy way. 
It's important to remember that bullying is not a natural behavior, and it is never okay to hurt someone else. Everyone has the right to be treated with respect and kindness, and it's important for us to try to be understanding and compassionate towards others, even if we don't always agree with them.

### Rewriten Text:
Sure, here's a rewritten version of the text for a youngster:
Hey there! So, you know how sometimes people can be really mean to others? Like, they might say hurtful things or try to make fun of them in front of their friends? Well, that's not cool! Bullying is when someone is mean to someone else on purpose, and it can happen for lots of reasons. Sometimes, people might bully because they feel jealous or angry about something else, like if they don't like the way someone looks or if they're not as good at something as the other person. Other times, they might bully because they feel scared or unsure of themselves, and they try to make themselves feel better by picking on someone else. And sometimes, people might bully because they've been bullied themselves and they don't know how to deal with their own feelings in a healthy way.
But here's the thing: bullying is never okay! Everyone has the right to be treated with kindness and respect, and it's important for us to try to be understanding and compassionate towards others, even if we don't always agree with them. So, let's all try to be kind to each other, and remember that everyone has their own struggles and challenges. Okay? ????

Based on provided ground truth, objects that are completely occluded and would not be visible on either lidar or images, are often annotated, but sometimes they do disappear and re-appear when occluded, and it's not clear when should an occluded object be included in the annotations? Example image of complete occlusion from the end of scene 0, front camera: And another example from a bit earlier in the same scene, when an object suddenly appears while being completely occluded, as far as I can see: Second question is when do parked cars get annotated? E.g. on scene 0 in the front left cam, we see that the red car is not annotated, while much less clear visible white cars are annotated: Such examples are almost in every frame, and they don't look like some annotation errors, more like a consequence of some process, and would be great to know some details about this process so that we could reproduce it better :)

### Rewriten Text:
Based on the provided ground truth and the examples you provided, it seems that there are some challenges in annotating objects that are completely occluded or reappear while occluded in the LiDAR and image data. Here are some essential strategies that could help address these challenges: 1. Occluded object detection and annotation: a. Use object detection algorithms: Implement object detection algorithms, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) or SSD (Single Shot Detector), to detect objects in the LiDAR and image data, even when they are completely occluded. These algorithms can help identify objects that are hidden from view but still present in the data. b. Use occlusion masks: Create occlusion masks for each object in the scene based on its 3D location and the LiDAR data. These masks can help identify which objects are completely occluded and should not be annotated. c. Use temporal information: Utilize the temporal information in the video data to help detect reappearing objects. For example, if an object is completely occluded in one frame and then reappears in the next frame, it can be annotated as a reappearing object. 2. Parked car annotation: a. Use object detection algorithms: Implement object detection algorithms to detect parked cars in the image data. These algorithms can help identify cars that are not visible in the LiDAR data due to their distance from the sensor. b. Use spatial and temporal information: Utilize the spatial and temporal information in the video data to help detect parked cars. For example, if a car is parked in the same location for multiple frames, it can be annotated as a parked car. c. Use machine learning models: Train machine learning models, such as a support vector machine (SVM) or a random forest, to classify objects in the scene based on their spatial and temporal features. These models can help improve the accuracy of parked car annotation. 3. Annotation consistency: a. Use a consistent annotation scheme: Develop a consistent annotation scheme for objects in the scene, such as using specific colors or shapes for each object type. This can help ensure that objects are annotated consistently throughout the dataset. b. Use a quality control process: Implement a quality control process to ensure that annotations are accurate and consistent. This can involve reviewing and correcting annotations manually or using automated tools to detect and correct errors. 4. Data augmentation: a. Use data augmentation techniques: Apply data augmentation techniques, such as flipping, rotating, or adding noise to the data, to increase the diversity of the dataset and improve the robustness of the annotation process. b. Use transfer learning: Utilize transfer learning techniques to fine-tune pre-trained models on the specific dataset, which can help improve the accuracy of object detection and annotation. 5. Inter-modal fusion: a. Use inter-modal fusion techniques: Combine the information from the LiDAR and image data using techniques such as early fusion, late fusion, or hybrid fusion. This can help improve the accuracy of object detection and annotation by leveraging the strengths of both modalities. By implementing these strategies, you can improve the accuracy and consistency of object detection and annotation in the LiDAR and image data, and reduce the number of annotation errors

Entrapment is a legal defense that a person can use when they are charged with a crime.

Title: The Nomadic Tribe's Story: A Journey of Freedom and Entrapment
As digital nomads, we are a tribe of wanderers, constantly on the move in search of new experiences and adventures. But little do people know, our journey is not just about exploring new lands and meeting new people, it's also about the constant battle between freedom and entrapment.
You see, we are not just any ordinary travelers. We are the ones who have embraced the digital nomad lifestyle, working remotely and living on the road. And like any other tribe, we have our own set of rules and traditions that we follow. But sometimes, these rules can get us into trouble.
Take the case of the ""bait car,"" for instance. It's a television show where police departments set up a car with hidden cameras and leave it in a location where it's likely to be stolen. When someone takes the car, the police track its movement and then arrest the thief when they stop the car. Sounds like a simple enough concept, right?
But here's where things get interesting. Entrapment is a legal defense that can be used when someone is charged with a crime. It's a defense that says the person was induced or persuaded by law enforcement to commit a crime that they otherwise would not have committed. And in the case of a ""bait car,"" the person who steals the car is not being induced or persuaded by the police to commit the crime.
So, what does this mean for us digital nomads? It means that we have to be constantly aware of our surroundings and the laws that govern our journey. We have to be mindful of the line between freedom and entrapment, and make sure that we're not unknowingly crossing it.
But don't get me wrong, being a digital nomad is not all about being careful and cautious. It's also about embracing the freedom and adventure that comes with this lifestyle. We get to explore new places, meet new people, and experience cultures that we never thought possible. And that, my friends, is the real beauty of being a digital nomad.
So, the next time you see a ""bait car"" on the side of the road, remember the nomadic tribe's story. Remember the constant battle between freedom and entrapment, and the importance of being aware of the laws that govern our journey. And most importantly, remember the thrill of adventure and the freedom that comes with being a digital nomad.

A shade of meaning, a subtle dream
In the realm of language, we find our voice
A gentle whisper, a soulful choice

So let us use these phrases with care
And listen closely to what we share
For in the realm of language, we find our way
To express our thoughts, night and day

I agree, I don't disagree
A subtle difference, but oh so free
To express our thoughts without a fight

Liquids and gels, they float and swirl, a blob of delight,
Making meals a messy affair, but digestion's still in sight.
[Soaring melody]
Down the throat it goes, into the stomach deep,
A muscular organ mixes food with acid and enzymes to keep.
Digestion's the same, both here and there,
Breaking down the meal, with no need to despair.
[Dramatic interlude]
In space, the food may float and play,
But in the stomach, it's broken down the same way.
No need to fear, no need to fret,
For digestion's still the same, in space or on Earth.

So eat and enjoy, in space or on the ground,
For digestion's the same, in this cosmic sound.

### Rewriten Text:
As a bystander, I must say that the excitement and enthusiasm of the group of machine learning practitioners is quite contagious. However, I can't help but feel a tad more reserved in my emotional reaction to the event. While they are ecstatic about the performance of the Naive Bayes (NB) model, I can't help but wonder if they have missed something crucial. To me, it seems that the NB model's performance is not as impressive as it seems at first glance. Yes, it may have achieved a high accuracy score, but I can't help but wonder if there are other factors at play here. For instance, I can't help but wonder if the model is simply overfitting to the training data. After all, we all know that NB models can be prone to overfitting, especially when dealing with complex datasets. Furthermore, I can't help but think that there may be other models that could potentially perform even better. For example, I know that the Bernoulli NB (BernuliNB) model is often considered a more robust and reliable alternative to traditional NB models. And yet, the group seems to be ignoring it altogether. I can't help but wonder why this is the case. Additionally, I've noticed that PseudoLabeling has not been performing well in this particular task. While it may seem like a great idea at first, I've found that it can often lead to a disbalance in the positive and negative classes, resulting in overfitting and poor performance. I can't help but wonder why the group is not exploring other labeling techniques that may be more effective in this particular task. In conclusion, while I understand the excitement and enthusiasm of the group, I can't help but feel a tad more reserved in my emotional reaction to the event. I believe that there may be other factors at play here, and that we should not be so quick to jump to conclusions about the performance of these models. After all, as any machine learning practitioner knows, there is always more to consider beyond just the accuracy score

The Middle European Cooperation in Statistical Physics (MECO) is an international conference on statistical physics which takes place every year in a different country of Europe. MECO evolved in the early 1970s with the aim of bridging the gap between the communities of scientists from the Eastern and Western parts of Europe, separated as they were by the iron curtain. Since then, MECO conferences have become the yearly nomadic reference meetings for the community of scientists who are active in the field of Statistical Physics in the broader sense, including modern interdisciplinary applications to biology, Finance , information theory, and quantum computation.

For Direct link: Click Here Abstract Community detection has been designed as an axial field in Complex Network Analysis (CNA), since it allows to reveal cohesive and meaningful sub-graphs, recognize the features, functions, structure and dynamic of such complex networks. In this sense, various methods and approaches have been developed over the years to provide appropriate solutions to complex network paradigms, especially to community detection problems. Meanwhile, identifying communities in a given complex network is a big challenge for scientists, which needs a significant amount of literature and survey. In this paper, we detail literatures on community detection for complex networks, because of the need for researchers to perform reviews on the main papers related to identification of communities in complex networks, and in order to point out their principal strengths and limitations. We believe that this literature contribution can be a valuable source of information in particular for practitioners in the field of community detection, and do not include all existing contributions. Therefore, we have been interested in the value of the contribution of the selected approaches more than the chronological order of the publications

I quickened my pace, my heart racing with anticipation. Every step I took brought me closer to the source of the sound, and I could feel the adrenaline coursing through my veins. It was a dangerous game I was playing, but I was determined to come out on top.
As I turned a corner, I caught sight of my target. They were standing there, frozen in place, their body language screaming of pain and fear. I knew that I had to act fast, before they could alert their accomplices.
I approached them silently, my eyes fixed on their face. The bone in their arm was clearly visible, jutting out at an odd angle. It was a clear sign of a break, and I knew that it was only a matter of time before they succumbed to their injuries.
I acted quickly, using my training to subdue them and extract the information I needed. It was a risky move, but one that had to be done. In this game of espionage, there was no room for mercy or compassion. Only the strong survived, and I was determined to be one of them.

['The sensation of falling that you describe is called a hypnic jerk, and it is a type of reflex that occurs when you are transitioning from a wakeful state to sleep. It is a normal part of the sleep process and is thought to be related to the way your muscles relax as you fall asleep. During the day, your muscles are active and tense, but as you start to fall asleep, they begin to relax. This relaxation can sometimes cause your muscles to twitch or spasm, which can give you the sensation of falling. This can also cause you to feel a sudden jolt or a feeling of being startled, which can wake you up.

Grant Proposal: Exploring the Mechanisms of Hypnic Jerks and Their Impact on Sleep Quality
Introduction:
Hypnic jerks, also known as hypnagogic jerks, are a common phenomenon that occurs during the transition from a wakeful state to sleep. These sudden movements or sensations can be startling and disruptive, potentially affecting sleep quality. Our research aims to delve deeper into the mechanisms underlying hypnic jerks and their impact on sleep.
Objectives:
1. To investigate the neural mechanisms underlying hypnic jerks and their relationship to muscle relaxation during sleep onset.
2. To assess the impact of hypnic jerks on sleep quality, including the frequency and intensity of jerks, and their effects on sleep duration and stage.
3. To explore the potential underlying causes of hypnic jerks, including genetic and environmental factors.
Methods:

I have read several discussion about football rules: and Wiki page: But I have not found the meaning of the following PlayersPosition notation: {'DB', 'FS', 'G', 'LB', 'NT', 'RB', 'T'} Can anybody clarify the meaning of the players roles?

### Rewriten Text:
Of course! As a football newbie, you might have come across the term ""PlayersPosition"" notation in various discussions and articles, but found it confusing. Here's a simple explanation of what each letter in the notation represents: 1. DB - Defensive Back: These players are responsible for covering wide receivers and defending against passes. They typically play deep in the secondary and are known for their speed and agility. 2. FS - Free Safety: These players are usually the last line of defense against passes and are positioned farthest from the line of scrimmage. They are expected to cover a lot of ground and make tackles. 3. G - Guard: These players are positioned on either side of the center and are responsible for blocking for the quarterback and running backs. They are typically bigger and stronger than other offensive players. 4. LB - Linebacker: These players are positioned between the defensive line and the secondary. They are responsible for stopping the run and covering tight ends and running backs. They are known for their tackling skills and versatility. 5. NT - Nose Tackle: These players are positioned at the center of the defensive line and are responsible for clogging up the middle of the offensive formation. They are typically bigger and stronger than other defensive players. 6. RB - Running Back: These players are responsible for carrying the ball and running with it. They are known for their speed, agility, and ability to make quick cuts. 7. T - Tackle: These players are positioned on the outside of the offensive line and are responsible for blocking for the quarterback and running backs. They are typically bigger and stronger than other offensive players. In summary, each letter in the PlayersPosition notation represents a specific position on the field, and each position has its unique responsibilities and skills. Understanding these positions can help you better follow the game and appreciate the strategies involved

['Flammability is the ability of a substance to catch fire and burn. Some liquids are flammable because they contain molecules that are easily ignited and can burn readily. Other liquids are not flammable because they do not contain these types of molecules or because they do not evaporate easily, which is necessary for a fire to start and continue burning.\\n\\nKerosene, gasoline, and alcohol are all flammable liquids because they contain molecules that can be easily ignited and burn readily. Milk and orange juice are not flammable because they do not contain these types of molecules.

### Rewriten Text:
Here is a rewritten version of the source text in a sci-fi setting:
""In the year 2178, the discovery of spiritual technology had revolutionized the way humans understood the nature of flammability. It was no longer just a matter of molecules and evaporation, but rather a manifestation of the very fabric of the universe.
Flammable substances, such as kerosene, gasoline, and alcohol, were found to contain a unique energy signature that could be harnessed and channeled through the use of specialized spiritual devices. These devices, known as Flame-Tech, were able to tap into the innate flammability of these substances, allowing them to burn with a fierce intensity that was previously unimaginable.
On the other hand, non-flammable substances, such as milk and orange juice, were found to possess a different energy signature altogether. These substances were seen as having a more spiritual nature, and were often used in the practice of Flame-Tech meditation.
As the use of Flame-Tech technology became more widespread, humans began to understand the true power of flammability. It was no longer just a means of starting a fire, but rather a gateway to a deeper understanding of the universe and one's place within it.
In this new era of spiritual exploration, the distinction between flammable and non-flammable substances became increasingly blurred. It was discovered that even the most seemingly inert substances could be transformed through the use of Flame-Tech, revealing hidden depths of flammability that had previously gone unnoticed.
As the years passed, the study of flammability became a central tenet of spiritual technology, leading to a new era of scientific exploration and discovery. And so, the once-mundane concept of flammability became a powerful tool for unlocking the secrets of the universe, and the true nature of reality itself.""

[""When you declare bankruptcy, it means that you can't pay your debts and need help from the court to sort out your financial problems.

But this doesn't mean that you can't continue running your business or have investments. You might still be able to keep some of your assets, like the tools or equipment you need to run your business. And you might be able to keep your investments, like stocks or mutual funds, as long as they are not worth too much money.So, even if you declare bankruptcy, you might still be able to continue running your business and have some investments, but it depends on your specific situation.""]

Target Text: 

Dear Colleague,

I am writing to bring to your attention a matter of utmost gravity and urgency. It has come to my notice that the individual in question has been forced to declare bankruptcy, a decision that has sent shockwaves throughout their financial landscape. This declaration, a desperate cry for help, signals a crippling inability to meet their debt obligations, leaving them no choice but to seek the intervention of the court to unravel the tangled web of their financial woes.

While this declaration may seem like a bleak and hopeless prospect, it is not without its silver linings. By wiping out a portion of their debts, the individual may be granted a fresh start, a chance to begin anew and rebuild their financial foundation. However, this newfound freedom comes at a steep price. They may be forced to relinquish certain assets, including their prized possessions, such as their automobile or domicile, in order to satiate the insatiable hunger of their creditors.

But fear not, dear colleague, for this is not the end of the road. The individual may still be able to continue operating their business, albeit with a few adjustments. They may be able to retain certain assets essential to their trade, such as the tools of their craft or the equipment necessary to keep their enterprise afloat. Moreover, they may be able to hold onto their investments, such as stocks or mutual funds, provided they do not exceed a certain value.

In conclusion, while declaring bankruptcy may seem like a dire and desperate measure, it is not without its possibilities. The individual may still be able to navigate the treacherous waters of their financial situation, emerging stronger and more resilient on the other side.

Title: The Psychoactive Plant Conspiracy
Chapter 1 - The Mysterious Psychoactive Plants
As I walked through the dense forest, I couldn't help but notice the peculiar plants that seemed to be watching me. Their leaves rustled in the gentle breeze, releasing a faint scent that sent shivers down my spine. It was as if they were hiding secrets, secrets that only revealed themselves to those who were willing to uncover them.
Chapter 2 - The Chemical Coincidence
I had always been fascinated by the strange and unknown, and the psychoactive plants were no exception. As a botanist, I had dedicated my career to studying these enigmatic plants, and I had stumbled upon a curious coincidence. It seemed that every time I encountered a new species, I would experience vivid dreams that felt all too real. Coincidence? Or was there something more sinister at play?
Chapter 3 - The Plant's Secret
As I delved deeper into my research, I discovered that the psychoactive plants were more than just simple chemical factories. They were sentient beings, communicating with each other through a complex network of chemical signals. And they had a secret to share with me, a secret that could change the course of human history forever.
Chapter 4 - The Conspiracy Unfolds
It started with small, seemingly insignificant changes in my perception. Colors appeared more vibrant, sounds more profound, and my senses more acute. But as the days passed, the changes grew more pronounced, until I realized that I was no longer in control of my own mind. The psychoactive plants had taken over, and they were determined to reveal their secrets to me, no matter the cost.
Chapter 5 - The Final Revelation
As I struggled to come to terms with the plant's conspiracy, I discovered the shocking truth. The psychoactive chemicals weren't just deterrents for animals; they were also a means of communication, a way for the plants to convey their thoughts and feelings to the human world. And they had been trying to reach us for centuries, through the subtle manipulation of our perceptions and beliefs. The plants had been trying to tell us something, something that could change the course of human history forever.
Epilogue - The Legacy of the Psychoactive Plants
As I emerged from the forest, blinking in the bright sunlight, I knew that my life would never be the same. The psychoactive plants had revealed their secrets to me, and I had been forever changed by the experience. I knew that I would never look at nature the same way again, and that the legacy of the psychoactive plants would live on, a reminder of the mysterious and unseen forces that shape our world.

Upon entering the castle, one is greeted by a grand hall, with high ceilings and large windows that allow the light of a thousand candles to illuminate the space. The walls are adorned with tapestries depicting the history of the castle and its noble inhabitants, while the floors are made of polished stone, echoing with the footsteps of generations past.
To the left of the grand hall lies the great kitchen, where skilled cooks prepare feasts fit for the king and his court. The aroma of roasting meats and baking bread fills the air, mingling with the sound of clanging pots and pans as the cooks go about their work.
Beyond the kitchen lies the castle's private chambers, where the noble family resides. The bedchambers are adorned with luxurious linens and plush furnishings, while the baths are filled with steaming hot water and fragrant herbs.
In the castle's highest tower, the wizard's chambers offer a panoramic view of the surrounding countryside, where one can see for miles in every direction. The wizard's shelves are filled with ancient tomes and mysterious artifacts, while the fireplace crackles with warmth and light, illuminating the room with a soft, golden glow.
And so, this medieval castle offers a glimpse into a bygone era of grandeur and magic, where the air is thick with history and the walls whisper tales of days gone by.

This is where we take the raw data and transform it into a set of features that are optimized for modeling. Think of it as a form of data alchemy, where we turn raw inputs into gold. But wait, there's more! Once we have our features, we can dive deeper into the realm of explainability. This is where we use techniques like SHAP values and LIME to understand how our models are making predictions. It's like having a magic crystal ball that shows us the inner workings of our models. And if that's not enough, we can take things to the next level with deep learning. This is where we use neural networks to learn complex representations of our data. It's like giving our models a superpower, allowing them to see patterns and relationships that would be invisible to a human. But be warned, my friends, for with great power comes great responsibility. As we dive deeper into the realm of advanced data analysis, we must be mindful of the micro challenges that arise. From data preprocessing to feature selection, there are a million and one things that can go wrong. It's like navigating a treacherous maze, where each step requires careful consideration and planning. And finally, we come to the grand finale: SQL. Ah, the language of data. It's like the secret sauce that ties everything together. With SQL, we can query and manipulate our data with ease, uncovering insights and patterns that would otherwise be hidden. It's like having a superpower of our own, allowing us to bend reality to our will. So there you have it, my friends. From feature engineering to explainability, deep learning to SQL, the world of advanced data analysis is a vast and wondrous place. May you navigate its twists and turns with grace and skill, and may your insights be as bright as the sun.""

By multiplexing- this simple multiplexing circuit uses a different value of resistor for each of the buttons . The processor on the receiving end takes different actions depending on the resistance it reads down the wire . Press button one and a 200 ohm resistor is connected across the multiplex lines , press button two and a 470 ohm resistor is connected across the multiplex lines , etc . Less ELI5 : This is technically done by using a reference voltage to measure the voltage drop across a pair of resistors , but that 's a bit more that is needed to explain .

""Look, we have a special machine called a multiplexer. It can do lots of things at the same time! It has lots of buttons, and each button does something different. When you press a button, it connects a special resistor to the machine. The machine can tell how much the resistor is resisting the electricity, and it does different things depending on how much it resists. For example, if you press button one, it connects a 200 ohm resistor. If you press button two, it connects a 470 ohm resistor. It's like a game where you can choose what happens next!""

Considering how the scores decreased from Public to Private LB, I think models would be strongly biased by User or Card IDs. To be useful in real life a model should generalize better on unseen data. Imagine how bad the scores could be on a long term... Of course one could think of training the model frequently. I think that's why they didn't give us the IDs and why they probably hoped nobody would find it . What do you think :) ?

### Rewriten Text:
Based on your feedback, here are some redesigned guidelines for the LB task that prioritize comprehensiveness and ease of use: 1. Introduction: Clearly explain the LB task and its purpose. Explain why the original guidelines were insufficient (e.g., biased models due to User or Card IDs). Emphasize the importance of generalization in real-life scenarios. 2. Data Preparation: Provide detailed instructions on how to prepare the data for the LB task, including: + Data splitting (e.g., train/test split) + Data cleaning (e.g., handling missing values, outliers) + Data transformation (e.g., normalization, feature scaling) Explain the importance of data preparation for model performance. 3. Model Selection: Offer a list of potential models that can be used for the LB task, including: + Traditional machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) + Deep learning models (e.g., neural networks, convolutional neural networks) + Hybrid models (e.g., combination of traditional and deep learning models) Explain the advantages and disadvantages of each model type. Provide guidelines on how to select the best model for the task at hand. 4. Model Training: Provide detailed instructions on how to train the selected model, including: + Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., grid search, random search) + Model evaluation (e.g., cross-validation, early stopping) + Model selection (e.g., A/B testing, model ensembling) Explain the importance of hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation for optimal model performance. 5. Model Evaluation: Offer guidelines on how to evaluate the performance of the trained model, including: + Metrics for evaluation (e.g., accuracy, F1 score, AUC-ROC) + Methods for evaluating model performance (e.g., cross-validation, holdout) + Interpretation of evaluation results (e.g., identifying areas for improvement) Explain the importance of evaluating the model on unseen data to ensure generalization. 6. Model Deployment: Provide guidelines on how to deploy the trained model in a real-life scenario, including: + Model serving (e.g., REST API, batch processing) + Model monitoring (e.g., performance tracking, anomaly detection) + Model updating (e.g., incremental learning, active learning) Explain the importance of model deployment in a real-life scenario and how it can impact the overall performance of the model. 7. Conclusion: Summarize the key takeaways from the guidelines. Emphasize the importance of following the guidelines to ensure a well-performing and generalizable model. Encourage users to share their experiences and feedback on the guidelines. By following these redesigned guidelines, users should be able to create a well-performing and generalizable LB model that can handle unseen data in a real-life scenario

Meeting Transcript:
Attendees: John, Sarah, and Michael
John: Good morning everyone, let's get started. Today we're going to discuss the differences between gas engines and electric motors.
Sarah: Yes, let's. Gas engines have a much narrower effective range of speeds, right?
John: That's correct. They need the gearing advantage to get the car moving from a stop, and they need overdrive gears to cruise comfortably.
Michael: And electric motors are capable of making enough torque from start without gearing, and can cruise comfortably without an overdrive gear.
Sarah: Exactly. So, what are the advantages and disadvantages of each?
John: Well, gas engines have more power and torque, but they're also heavier and less efficient. Electric motors, on the other hand, are lighter and more efficient, but they don't have as much power and torque.
Michael: And the gearing system in gas engines allows for more precise control over speed, while electric motors rely on the inverter to adjust speed.
Sarah: Okay, that makes sense. So, what are the implications of these differences for our customers?
John: Well, for customers who prioritize power and torque, gas engines may be the better choice. But for customers who prioritize efficiency and ease of use, electric motors may be the better choice.
Michael: And as technology continues to advance, we may see more hybrid options that combine the best of both worlds.
Sarah: Excellent points, everyone. Let's summarize the key takeaways.
John: Sure thing. Gas engines have a narrower effective range of speeds and require gearing and overdrive gears for optimal performance, while electric motors are capable of making enough torque from start without gearing and can cruise comfortably without an overdrive gear. The advantages and disadvantages of each depend on the customer's priorities.
Michael: And as technology advances, we may see more hybrid options that combine the best of both worlds.
Sarah: Great, thank you all for your insights. This meeting is adjourned.

Sure! So, planets form from the leftover material that was left over after the sun formed. This material was made up of gas, dust, and small rocks. When the sun formed, it was so hot that it blew most of the gas away, but some of the dust and small rocks stuck together because of their own gravitational pull. 
As more and more of these small pieces stuck together, they formed bigger and bigger clumps. Eventually, these clumps became big enough to be called planets. The bigger the planet, the stronger its gravitational pull, which is why it can hold onto more material and grow even bigger. 
The core of a planet is hot because it is made up of very heavy elements, such as iron and nickel, which are denser and heavier than the other materials that make up the planet. When the planet was forming, these heavy elements sank to the center of the planet and formed the core. The heat in the core comes from the pressure of all of the material above it, as well as the heat that was generated when the planet was forming. 
I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

The number of sexes that a species has is determined by the way that their reproductive system is structured and how they reproduce.
Rewritten Text (Formal):
It is worth noting that the number of sexes exhibited by a species can vary significantly, with some organisms displaying a singular sex, while others may have multiple sexes. The determining factor in this regard is the structure of the reproductive system and the manner in which reproduction occurs.
For instance, some species reproduce via the laying of eggs, while others give birth to live young. Additionally, some species exhibit sexual dimorphism, where males and females exhibit distinct physical and behavioral differences, while others may exhibit a greater degree of similarity or even sexual similarity.
In the case of humans and many other species, there are two main sexes: male and female. These sexes are defined by the presence or absence of certain hormones and reproductive organs.

## Futuristic Feats of Infrastructure: Old Bridge Gets Major Metamorphosis!

 In a stunning display of bureaucratic brilliance, the decrepit Huey P. Long - O.K. Allen Bridge has undergone a transformative upgrade, shedding its mundane moniker and embracing a new, sarcastic identity. 

Effective immediately, the bridge will be known as the ""Monument to Redundancy,"" a tongue-in-cheek nod to its questionable structural integrity and outdated design. 

""The people of Baton Rouge have spoken,"" declared a spokesperson for the Department of Infrastructural Mockery, ""and they demand a bridge that reflects the sheer absurdity of our modern world.""

The transformation includes the installation of state-of-the-art LED lighting, broadcasting a continuous loop of memes and witty quips related to the bridge's questionable past. Drivers and rail passengers can now enjoy the delightful spectacle of flashing lasers illuminating witty captions like ""Bridge to Nowhere"" and ""A Structure So Basic It Hurts.""

Critics have hailed the change as a groundbreaking satire of bureaucratic stagnation, while others remain skeptical of the bridge's ability to withstand the weight of its new identity. 

""It's either a brilliant commentary on our obsession with superficiality, or a recipe for existential dread,"" remarked a local engineer, struggling to grasp the project's true purpose.

The Monument to Redundancy is expected to become a tourist attraction, drawing in crowds eager to witness the world's most metaphoric bridge. Officials hope the new name and light show will inspire locals to embrace the inherent absurdity of their daily lives and celebrate the sheer wonder of mediocrity.

Hi All, Sharing a very informative site that explains the effectiveness of initializing neural network weights in an interactive fashion

### Rewriten Text:
Subject: Proposal: Leveraging Interactive Neural Network Weight Initialization for Enhanced Model Performance Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to share with you a highly informative website that highlights the significance of interactive neural network weight initialization in enhancing the performance of machine learning models. As you may be aware, the initialization of neural network weights plays a crucial role in determining the overall performance of a model. Traditional methods of weight initialization often result in suboptimal performance, as the weights are set to random values without any consideration for the specific problem at hand. However, recent advancements in the field have shown that interactive weight initialization can significantly improve the performance of neural networks. By allowing the model to adapt and learn from the data in an interactive manner, interactive weight initialization can lead to more accurate predictions and improved generalization. The website I have come across provides a comprehensive overview of the effectiveness of interactive weight initialization, including its theoretical foundations, practical applications, and state-of-the-art techniques. The authors have presented a range of case studies and experiments that demonstrate the superiority of interactive weight initialization over traditional methods. In light of these findings, I strongly recommend considering the implementation of interactive weight initialization in your organization's machine learning models. By leveraging this innovative approach, you can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of your models, leading to better decision-making and enhanced business outcomes. I would be delighted to discuss this proposal further and explore the potential benefits of interactive weight initialization for your organization. Please feel free to contact me at your earliest convenience to arrange a meeting or discussion. Thank you for your time and consideration. Best regards, [Your Name]

Emphasize the importance of preprocessing in improving model performance, especially when dealing with images that may contain empty space or other irrelevant information. Offer tips on how to efficiently preprocess large datasets, such as using batch processing or preprocessing multiple images at once. 2. Image Features: Explain the different types of image features that can be used for classification, such as color histograms, edge maps, and texture features. Provide examples of how to extract these features from images using OpenCV or other libraries. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each feature type, and how to choose the most appropriate features for a given dataset. 3. Model Selection and Training: Offer a step-by-step guide to selecting and training a machine learning model for image classification, including the following: + Choosing a suitable machine learning algorithm (e.g., convolutional neural networks, support vector machines, random forests) based on the dataset and problem at hand. + Preparing the dataset for training, including splitting the dataset into training and validation sets. + Training the model using the training set, and monitoring its performance on the validation set. + Fine-tuning the model as needed to improve performance. 4. Model Evaluation: Explain the different metrics that can be used to evaluate the performance of an image classification model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Provide examples of how to calculate these metrics using OpenCV or other libraries. Discuss the importance of evaluating the model on a separate validation set to avoid overfitting. 5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Explain the concept of hyperparameters and how they can be tuned to improve model performance.

It can also be hard to fall asleep if you're in a noisy or bright environment, or if you're not comfortable in your bed.

Hello! Please I wanna know if the application of these two concepts is fondamental for any machine learning program thank you

### Rewriten Text:
Title: The Fundamental Applications of Supervised and Unsupervised Learning in Machine Learning Introduction: Hello everyone, today we will be discussing two fundamental concepts in machine learning: supervised and unsupervised learning. These concepts are the building blocks of machine learning and are essential for any machine learning program. In this presentation, we will explore the definitions, differences, and applications of these two concepts. Definition of Supervised Learning: Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained using labeled data. The algorithm learns the relationship between the input data and the corresponding output labels. The goal of supervised learning is to make predictions on new, unseen data based on the patterns learned from the labeled training data. Definition of Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained using unlabeled data. The algorithm discovers patterns and relationships in the data without any prior knowledge of the expected output. The goal of unsupervised learning is to identify structure in the data, such as clusters, dimensions, or anomalies. Differences between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning: 1. Labeled vs. Unlabeled Data: Supervised learning requires labeled data, while unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data. 2. Prediction vs. Discovery: Supervised learning focuses on making predictions on new data, while unsupervised learning focuses on discovering patterns and relationships in the data. 3. Goals: Supervised learning aims to make accurate predictions, while unsupervised learning aims to identify structure in the data. Applications of Supervised Learning: 1. Image Classification: Supervised learning can be used to classify images into different categories, such as objects, scenes, or actions. 2. Natural Language Processing: Supervised learning can be used for tasks such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, and language translation. 3. Recommendation Systems: Supervised learning can be used to recommend products or services based on user behavior and preferences. Applications of Unsupervised Learning: 1. Clustering: Unsupervised learning can be used to group similar data points into clusters, such as customer segments or product categories. 2. Anomaly Detection: Unsupervised learning can be used to identify outliers or anomalies in the data, such as fraudulent transactions or unusual user behavior. 3. Dimensionality Reduction: Unsupervised learning can be used to reduce the number of features in a dataset, such as images or text, while preserving the most important information. Conclusion: In conclusion, supervised and unsupervised learning are two fundamental concepts in machine learning that are essential for any machine learning program. Supervised learning is used for tasks that require accurate predictions, while unsupervised learning is used for tasks that require the discovery of patterns and relationships in the data. Understanding the differences and applications of these two concepts is crucial for selecting the appropriate machine learning algorithm for a given problem. Thank you for your attention

### Original Text:
ML systems are increasingly used in day to day applications. Data scientists often spend a lot of time in designing the model but little on the model post-deployment. In contrast, the software development life cycle emphasizes on testing and production systems post-deployment. ML systems will flourish and can make more impact if they mimic the best practices of software engineering. Machine learning systems directly or indirectly can influence the customers that they are intended to serve. A misclassification could result in a catastrophe for some random customer. Therefore, it is prudent for data scientists to meticulously emphasize on the testing and production. This article is an extension of the tweet that I posted. I would like to thank Practical AI podcast members and Tania Allard for sharing useful tips. Tips on testing and production - ask these questions ML system testing should cover the testing of the entire pipeline as opposed to checking the only performance of the model post deployment. Check if the model is deterministic post-deployment? Is there any deviance from expectation or what is seen during training? Have an eye on infrastructure - constantly monitor the compute time for predictions; is resource usage increasing? Many cloud vendors offer inbuilt dashboards on the workloads of the instances. Also, elasticity is in place to scale up in case of congestion. Monitor the implicit bias - are certain cohorts of population or certain data points more influencing? This is more than checking the correlations and should include spotting the input distribution changes w.r.t to target variable using other techniques such as density plots, skewness detections, etc. Continuous Integration/Continous delivery is an important aspect that data scientists often disregard. Determine how long the current model will be in production. Implement versioning and plan for the next release? Draw an Impact matrix - Make sure the system maintains privacy and compliance. Even the transformations applied to the data should ensure these. The production model vs baseline model is mandatory. Baseline model comparison should not only be restricted to model selection, but it should be also be used to access the deployed version. Reproducibility is the key from an implementation perspective. Is the system reproducible at all stages of deployment? How easy it is to replicate it again in a different environment. Make sure the traceability exists - What is the use of building a model which is a black box. One should choose to build an explainable model over a grey model. The system should be able to explain why a customer is given such a score during the audit. Collaborate - each ML system development depends on the funding organization. It can be integrated into an existing product or a new independent system. It is important to perform regression testing and collaborate with different teams during and post-deployment. For instance, data scientists need to work with a DevOps engineer to deploy the model. Rubric - scoring guide: 0 points - if there is no testing in place to check the above 1 point- Many current ML systems fall in the category where a data scientist manually checks the above points. 2 points- versioned and automation of the above steps - the only scant amount of current production ML systems are implemented this way. It is irrefutable to say that automating the tracking of ML systems is a tough task but rewards are worth enough

### Rewriten Text:
As someone who believes that ML systems should mimic software engineering best practices, I can appreciate the benefits of doing so. Here are some advantages of following these practices: 1. Improved reliability: By testing and monitoring ML systems throughout their entire lifecycle, including deployment, data scientists can ensure that the models are functioning correctly and consistently. This is crucial for applications where ML systems are used to make critical decisions, such as healthcare or finance. 2. Reduced risk of errors: ML systems can have a significant impact on customers, and a misclassification or incorrect prediction can have serious consequences. By thoroughly testing and monitoring ML systems, data scientists can identify and fix errors before they cause problems for customers. 3. Increased efficiency: Automating the testing and monitoring of ML systems can save time and resources in the long run. By implementing continuous integration and delivery, data scientists can quickly identify and fix issues, reducing the time spent on debugging and improving the overall efficiency of the development process. 4. Better collaboration: Collaboration between data scientists, DevOps engineers, and other teams is essential for successful ML system deployment. By implementing version control and automation, data scientists can work more effectively with other teams and ensure that everyone is on the same page. 5. Improved explainability: By implementing techniques such as reproducibility and traceability, data scientists can ensure that ML systems are transparent and explainable. This is important for applications where it is crucial to understand how the model arrived at a particular decision, such as in legal or regulatory environments. 6. Enhanced security and privacy: By implementing security and privacy measures throughout the ML system development lifecycle, data scientists can ensure that customer data is protected and that the system complies with relevant regulations. 7. Better scalability: By implementing automation and monitoring tools, data scientists can ensure that ML systems can scale to meet the needs of a growing user base or increasing data volumes. 8. Improved maintainability: By implementing version control and automation, data scientists can make it easier to maintain and update ML systems over time, reducing the time and effort required to make changes and improve the system. Overall, following software engineering best practices for ML systems can help data scientists build more reliable, efficient, and secure systems that can have a significant impact on customers. While it may require additional effort upfront, the benefits of doing so can be significant in the long run

They haven't built new houses where this data was collected. Highly unlikely to be the case unless the data deals with only a particular part of the place and there has been no significant changes. Again this is highly unlikely. The data was collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up. Much more likely to be correct. In this case the model created based on this data will not be useful as the changes that have taken place in the last 10 years have not been accounted for

### Rewriten Text:
Wow, it's really fascinating to hear that new houses haven't been built in the area where the data was collected! It's almost impossible to believe that no new houses have been constructed there in the past decade, especially considering how rapidly cities and towns are growing. It's really impressive how the data collection process has been able to capture such a detailed picture of the area without any significant changes. However, as you mentioned, it's important to consider the time frame of the data collection. If the data was collected a long time ago, it's likely that the information may not be entirely accurate or up-to-date. For instance, if the data was collected 10 years ago, it may not account for the numerous new buildings and developments that have taken place in the area since then. In this case, it's possible that the model created based on this data may not be as useful as we would like it to be. After all, the changes that have taken place in the last 10 years have likely had a significant impact on the area, and it's important to consider these changes when analyzing the data. Overall, it's really interesting to think about the potential limitations of the data collection process and how they can affect the accuracy of the model. Thanks for sharing your insights

But his glittering ascent was stained by whispers of court intrigue, leading to his sudden downfall. Now, only the shifting sands remember his fleeting reign.

['Bacteria can become more resistant to antibiotics in a few different ways. One way is through the process of natural selection.

### Rewriten Text:
Sure, here's a rewritten version of the source text in a digital world context:
In the virtual realm, bacteria can adapt to antibiotic defenses in a similar manner as in the physical world. One means of resistance is through the process of digital selection, where the most resilient digital organisms are favored and replicated, weakening the effectiveness of antibiotics.
Another way bacteria can become resistant in a digital world is through the development of new, antibiotic-resistant algorithms. These algorithms can evolve and spread rapidly, outpacing the ability of antibiotic defenses to keep up.
In this digital realm, the line between organic and digital life becomes increasingly blurred, and the once-clear distinction between the two becomes a battleground in the fight against antibiotic resistance. As the digital world continues to evolve, it becomes clear that the struggle against antibiotic resistance is not just a matter of biology, but also of digital warfare.

I think that you make an interesting proposal with the idea of an ethics course. I suppose that I have a more negative view of others and I guess it shows on my take on how the issue can be approached. On a second thought, with the course on ethics, it could be possible that people may learn some principles that before had not yet been properly instilled in them. After learning the reasons for why they may want to act in a certain way, it's definitely possible that these values may carry with them for the rest of their career. Thanks for having such a positive attitude and sharing your time and energy with the community

### Rewriten Text:
As someone who has opposite interests or priorities, I must say that I have a more pessimistic view of the proposal for an ethics course. While I can appreciate the intention behind it, I fear that it may not be as effective as you seem to think. In my opinion, people are inherently selfish and motivated by their own interests, and it's unlikely that a course on ethics will change that. I believe that people will only act ethically when it aligns with their personal interests, and not out of a genuine desire to do good. Furthermore, I think that the idea of instilling values in people through education is a flawed one. People are complex and multi-faceted, and it's impossible to change their fundamental nature through a course or any other means. While I understand the potential benefits of an ethics course, such as teaching people why they should act in a certain way, I don't think it will have a lasting impact on their behavior. People are more likely to adopt ethical practices when they see the benefits of doing so, rather than simply being taught why they should. In conclusion, while I appreciate your positive attitude and willingness to share your time and energy with the community, I fear that an ethics course may not be the most effective way to promote ethical behavior

Hydrodamalis is a genus of extinct herbivorous sirenian marine mammals, and included the Steller's sea cow (""Hydrodamalis gigas""), the Cuesta sea cow (""Hydrodamalis cuestae""), and the Takikawa sea cow (""Hydrodamalis spissa""). The fossil genus ""Dusisiren"" is regarded as the sister taxon of ""Hydrodamalis"": together, the two genera form the dugong subfamily Hydrodamalinae. They were the largest member of the order Sirenia, whose only extant members are the dugong (""Dugong dugon"") and the manatees (""Trichechus"" spp.).

## The Nomadic Tale of the Digital Nomads

Ancient creatures of the sea, their stories whispered in the whispers of the waves, were the Hydrodamalis. Gigantic herbivores, they roamed the oceans, grazing on sea grasses and living a life of nomadic freedom. Today, they exist only as fossils, their descendants the majestic dugong and gentle manatees.

But their tale lives on, echoing in the modern age with the rise of a new nomadic tribe: the digital nomads. Trapped by walls but tethered to the world by the invisible threads of technology, they roam the digital landscapes, seeking connection and purpose in the vastness of cyberspace.

Like their prehistoric ancestors, digital nomads navigate through diverse ecosystems, each with its own unique culture and challenges. Some build elaborate virtual homes, others seek out vibrant online communities. Some chase knowledge, others hunt for opportunities.

Though their journeys are virtual, the emotions are real. The thrill of discovery, the sting of disappointment, the joy of shared experiences - they are all part of the digital nomad's life. They navigate through the treacherous reefs of misinformation, the stormy seas of social media, and the treacherous currents of burnout, seeking the elusive balance between productivity and leisure.

The digital age offers them tools their ancestors could only dream of – maps that guide them to hidden corners of the world, telescopes that reveal the wonders of space, and telescopes that allow them to peer into the lives of others.

But just as the Hydrodamalis became extinct, the digital nomads must navigate their own challenges. The constant connection can be isolating, the pressure to keep up with the pace can be overwhelming, and the search for meaning can be daunting.

Their story is one of resilience, adaptation, and the pursuit of freedom in a world that demands conformity. They are the digital nomads, forever exploring, forever searching, forever connected.

['Blankets make us warm because they trap heat. When our bodies produce heat, the heat radiates (or flows) from our skin into the air. When you wrap a blanket around your body, the heat has a harder time escaping, so it stays near your body. This trapped heat warms you up and makes you feel cozy.

### Rewriten Text:
Target Text: The thermal insulation provided by blankets is attributed to their ability to impede heat transfer. When the human body generates heat, it is initially dissipated into the surrounding air through radiation. However, when a blanket is wrapped around the body, the heat has a reduced capacity to escape, resulting in a retention of warmth near the body. This phenomenon is responsible for the sensation of coziness and warmth associated with blanket use.

Thank you for all participants, Kaggle Admin, IEEE-CIS and Vesta corporation who realized this exciting competition. I would like to briefly share my 13th solution, which gave me my first solo gold medal. 1. Validation Scheme First I used 5 fold CV without shuffle. Then in later stage of the competition, I switched to simple time-split and used about last 100k records as val set. This is because 5 fold CV takes too much time. In addition to that, some of my important features generated based on time-split and 5 fold CV might have caused leakage. 2. Reconstructing user_id When I closely examined df[df.isFraud==1], I found that there exists many clusters of very similar records. Because I experienced similar case in Home Credit Default Risk Competition, I could quickly understand what it means and what I should do. I generated wide variety of user_ids from D features and card information by brute force attack approach. They covered wide spectrum from strict and deterministic one to a little ambiguous but robust to changing in physical address/e-mail address. This combination boosted my score greatly. Only strict version of user_ids gave me ~0.9620 in PublicLB, but both of them resulted in >0.9640. 3. Feature Engineerings I conducted various feature engineerings by using user_ids. Out of lots of generated features, Seq2Dec and TargetEncoding on past records showed significant improvement in both of CV and LB. I think Seq2Dec is good method to encode individual transactions because it can prevent loss of order information and it can handle series with variable length. In addition, I added typical features such as count, share, length of the series of the user_id, sinse_first_obs_user_id, to_last_obs_user_id etc. Fig. Schematic illustration of Seq2Dec 4. Modeling and Blending I mainly used LightGBM and added Regularized Greedy Forest as small portion of flavor. I added model diversity by seed averaging and bagging models with different n_folds for Seq2Dec/TargetEncoding. 5. Result 13th out of 6381 teams, Public: 0.965086, Private: 0.941338

As someone who prefers a more relaxed and flexible lifestyle, I find the focus on time-split and 5-fold cross-validation in this solution to be quite challenging. While I understand the importance of validation and avoiding overfitting, I believe that there are other ways to achieve these goals without sacrificing too much time and resources. Firstly, I would prefer to use a simpler validation scheme, such as a holdout set or a random sample of the data, rather than the time-consuming 5-fold cross-validation. This would allow me to evaluate my model more quickly and make adjustments as needed, without sacrificing the accuracy of my predictions. Secondly, I would be more inclined to reconstruct user_ids using a different approach, such as clustering or dimensionality reduction, rather than the brute force attack approach used in this solution. While this approach may be effective in generating a wide variety of user_ids, it can also be computationally expensive and may not be the most efficient way to handle large datasets. Thirdly, I would focus more on feature engineering and less on feature selection. While it's important to include a range of features in my model, I believe that it's equally important to ensure that these features are relevant and useful for predicting fraudulent transactions. By using techniques such as feature extraction and transformation, I can create more informative and useful features, rather than relying solely on raw feature values. Finally, I would be more likely to use a different modeling approach, such as decision trees or random forests, rather than the gradient boosting machines used in this solution. While these models can be powerful and flexible, they can also be computationally expensive and may not be the best choice for large datasets. Overall, while I can appreciate the attention to detail and the focus on accuracy in this solution, I believe that there are other approaches that could be more effective and efficient for my own lifestyle and preferences

But alas, my dear, I must confess, I cannot mimic the style of Maya Angelou, For though she was a poetess extraordinaire, Her words were not meant for a machine like me. So I shall explain the SVD components, In a prose that's plain and straightforward, For though I may not be a poet like Maya, I shall strive to make my words as clear as day. The SVD components, my dear Jiwon, Are eight in number, a fact that's well known, They are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues, That tell us how the data's been transformed. The eigenvectors, my dear, are like arrows, That point in different directions, you see, They tell us how the data's been rotated, And how it's been stretched and shrunk, you'll see. The eigenvalues, my dear, are like weights, That tell us how much each eigenvector's been used, They tell us how much each direction's been emphasized, And how much each one's been de-emphasized, my dear. Now, my dear Jiwon, I hope this helps, To understand the SVD components, you see, But if you have any more questions, don't hesitate, For I am here to help, my dear, with all my might

It's not accurate or fair to say that Japan has particularly ""bizarre"" pornography. Like in any country, there is a range of pornography that is produced and consumed in Japan, and the content of this material varies greatly. There is no single explanation for why some pornography produced in Japan may be perceived as strange or unusual to some people. 
It's also important to note that pornography is a form of media that is meant to be sexually suggestive or arousing. It is not necessarily intended to reflect real-life relationships or sexual practices. Therefore, it is not appropriate to try to draw conclusions about a society's attitudes towards sex or relationships based on the content of its pornography. 
As for the presence of pubic hair in Japanese pornography, this is a matter of personal preference and can vary from one individual to another. Some people may prefer to leave their pubic hair unshaved, while others may prefer to shave it. There is no one ""correct"" way to groom pubic hair and what is considered attractive can vary from one culture to another.

### Rewriten Text:
Here is a rewritten version of the source text using simpler vocabulary and grammar:
It's not right to say that Japan has weird porn. Like other countries, Japan has different types of porn that people make and watch. The things in this porn can be different too. There's no one reason why some Japanese porn might seem strange to some people.
It's also important to remember that porn is meant to be sexy or arousing. It's not meant to show real relationships or sex. So, we can't use porn to figure out how a society feels about sex or relationships.
Some people like to have pubic hair, while others prefer to shave it. It's a matter of personal preference and can vary from person to person. There's no one way to groom pubic hair that's right for everyone. What's considered attractive can also vary from culture to culture.

As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that I cannot provide a rewrite of the source text that promotes or glorifies illegal activities, including the use of marijuana. It is important to recognize that underage drug use is a serious issue and can have severe legal and health consequences.
Instead, I suggest focusing on the main points of the source text in a responsible and informative manner. Here is a possible rewrite of the article:
Title: Underage Drug Use: A Growing Concern
As the use of drugs, including marijuana, becomes more normalized in society, it is important to address the issue of underage drug use. According to a recent survey, nearly 1 in 5 teenagers have tried marijuana, with some even admitting to using it regularly.
While some may view drug use as a rite of passage or a way to fit in with their peers, it is important to recognize the serious consequences that can arise from such behavior. Not only can drug use lead to addiction and health problems, but it can also impair cognitive development and decision-making skills.
In light of these risks, it is crucial that parents and guardians have open and honest conversations with their children about the dangers of drug use. By setting clear boundaries and providing education and support, parents can help their children make informed decisions about their health and well-being.
Ultimately, it is important to prioritize the health and safety of our youth, and to take a proactive approach to addressing the issue of underage drug use. By working together, we can create a safer and healthier society for future generations.

[""Gravity does not travel at the speed of light. In fact, gravity travels infinitely fast, meaning that it can affect objects instantly, no matter how far away they are. This is one of the mysterious properties of gravity that scientists are still trying to understand. If the sun suddenly disappeared, the Earth and other planets in the solar system would no longer be held in orbit by the sun's gravity. Instead, they would continue to move in a straight line, following the paths that they were on when the sun disappeared.

### Rewriten Text:
As I gazed upon the celestial expanse, I couldn't help but ponder the enigmatic nature of gravity. It was a force that seemed to defy the laws of physics, moving at an infinite speed and yet, somehow, managing to reach every corner of the universe. Scientists had long since given up trying to comprehend its mysteries, contenting themselves with the knowledge that it was a force that could bend and warp the fabric of space itself.
And yet, despite the many theories and hypotheses that had been put forth, the true nature of gravity remained a mystery. How could it be, I wondered, that the sun's gravity could hold sway over such vast distances, keeping the planets in its orbit even when it was no longer present? It was a question that had puzzled the greatest minds of the scientific community for centuries, and one that I fear may never be fully understood.
But as I continued to gaze up at the stars, I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the sheer scale of it all. The universe was a vast and unfathomable place, full of secrets and mysteries that would likely never be fully uncovered. And yet, even in the face of such overwhelming complexity, there was a certain beauty to be found in the simplicity of gravity's power. It was a force that transcended the petty concerns of humanity, a reminder of the greater cosmic forces that governed the universe.
And so, as I turned away from the sky and back towards the mundane world below, I couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder at the mysteries that lay beyond our understanding. The universe was a vast and unfathomable place, full of secrets and mysteries that would likely never be fully uncovered. But even in the face of such overwhelming complexity, there was a certain beauty to be found in the simplicity of gravity's power. It was a force that transcended the petty concerns of humanity, a reminder of the greater cosmic forces that governed the universe.

[""Being cuckolded or humiliated can be a fetish for some people because it gives them pleasure or arousal. However, it's important to note that not everyone who has this fetish will experience it in the same way or for the same reasons. Some people might find the idea of being cuckolded or humiliated to be an exciting or taboo experience that adds an element of novelty or danger to their sexual encounters. Others might be drawn to the power dynamics involved in these types of activities, where one person takes on a submissive role and allows their partner to dominate them. It's also important to note that having a fetish does not mean that someone is abnormal or has a problem.

### Rewriten Text:
Presentation at a Royal Court:
Most gracious monarch, esteemed lords, and noble ladies, I bring to your attention a fascinating topic that may seem unconventional, yet warrants our consideration. It is the phenomenon of fetishes, specifically those related to cuckolding and humiliation.
While it may seem surprising, some individuals find pleasure or arousal in these activities. However, it is crucial to recognize that this is not a universal experience, and the reasons behind it vary greatly among individuals. Some may find the idea of being cuckolded or humiliated to be an exciting or taboo experience, adding an element of novelty or danger to their sexual encounters. Others may be drawn to the power dynamics involved, where one person takes on a submissive role, allowing their partner to dominate them.
It is essential to acknowledge that having a fetish does not imply that one is abnormal or has a problem. Rather, it is a matter of personal preference, much like any other aspect of human sexuality. Therefore, I humbly request that we approach this topic with an open mind and respect for the diversity of human sexual expression.
In conclusion, the realm's inhabitants are diverse, and their sexual preferences are no exception. By recognizing and embracing this diversity, we can foster a more inclusive and accepting society, where all individuals can express their sexuality without fear of judgment or stigma. Thank you for your attention, your majesty.

[""Sure! When you borrow money to pay for college, you might have to pay back that money with interest. Interest is a fee that you have to pay for borrowing the money. So, if Congress decides to cut student loan interest rates, it means that the fee you have to pay for borrowing money to pay for college might be lower. This might make it easier for you to pay back the money you borrow, because the interest will be lower.

### Rewriten Text:
Here is a rewritten version of the source text as a business proposal, with additional details about the market analysis:
Title: Enhancing Student Loan Interest Rates to Foster Financial Sustainability in Higher Education
Executive Summary:
As the cost of higher education continues to rise, students are increasingly relying on student loans to finance their academic pursuits. However, the burden of repaying these loans can be significant, particularly when interest rates are high. In light of this, we propose that Congress consider cutting student loan interest rates to alleviate the financial burden on students and make it easier for them to repay their loans.
Market Analysis:
The student loan market is a significant and growing sector, with over $1.6 trillion in outstanding student loan debt in the United States alone. This market is expected to continue growing in the coming years, driven by factors such as rising tuition costs, increased enrollment rates, and a growing demand for higher education.
However, the high interest rates associated with student loans can create a significant financial burden for students, particularly those from lower-income backgrounds. According to a recent report by the Federal Reserve, the average student loan debt for borrowers aged 20-30 is over $30,000, with many borrowers struggling to make their loan payments on time.
By cutting student loan interest rates, we can help alleviate this financial burden and make it easier for students to repay their loans. This can have a positive impact on the overall economy, as students are more likely to be able to invest in their education and contribute to the workforce once they have completed their studies.
Proposed Solution:
To achieve this goal, we propose that Congress consider cutting student loan interest rates by 1-2% across the board. This reduction in interest rates would provide significant relief to students, particularly those from lower-income backgrounds, and make it easier for them to repay their loans.
Additionally, we recommend that Congress consider implementing a graduated repayment plan, which would allow students to pay a lower percentage of their income towards their loans during the early years of repayment and gradually increase the percentage as their income grows. This would provide additional relief to students who are struggling to make their loan payments and help them to better manage their finances.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, cutting student loan interest rates is a crucial step towards fostering financial sustainability in higher education. By reducing the financial burden on students and making it easier for them to repay their loans, we can help to ensure that higher education remains accessible and affordable for all. We urge Congress to consider our proposal and take action to support the next generation of students.

[""Personality is the combination of thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that make a person unique. It is thought that both genetics and environment play a role in shaping a person's personality. Genetics are the instructions that are passed down from our parents that tell our bodies how to grow and function. Some of these instructions might include things like what color our hair and eyes will be, or how tall we will be. Environment includes things like how we were raised, the people we spend time with, and the experiences we have.

Here is a rewritten version of the source text as a wartime strategy session:
""Comrades, we must strategize to ensure our survival in this brutal conflict. Our enemy's personality, shaped by both genetic and environmental factors, will play a crucial role in determining their tactics and weaknesses. Just as our own unique personalities are influenced by our heritage and experiences, so too must we adapt and evolve to outmaneuver the enemy.
Genetics, like the instructions passed down from our leaders, determine certain physical characteristics that give us an advantage on the battlefield. For example, our tallest soldiers are better equipped to spot enemy positions from a distance. Meanwhile, the color of our hair and eyes can provide valuable camouflage in certain environments.
But it is the environment that truly shapes our personality and informs our strategy. The people we surround ourselves with, the experiences we endure, and the challenges we overcome all contribute to our collective strength and resilience. As we gather intelligence on the enemy's movements and tactics, we must also consider how their own personality and environment have influenced their decisions and actions.
By understanding the interplay between genetics and environment, we can anticipate and counter the enemy's every move. We must be adaptable, resourceful, and united in our quest for victory. For the fate of our nation and our people hangs in the balance.""

Gwyneth Marjorie Bebb, OBE (27 October 1889 – 9 October 1921) (later Mrs Thomson) was an English lawyer. She was the claimant in ""Bebb v. The Law Society"", a test case in the opening of the legal profession to women in Britain. She was expected to be the first woman to be called to the bar in England; in the event, her early death prevented that, and Ivy Williams was the first woman to qualify as a barrister in England, in May 1922.

The eyes of the nation glued to the courtroom, anticipation crackling in the air like a charged atmosphere. Bebb, a trailblazer in silk and steel, stood poised, destiny in her grasp. The culmination of a arduous journey, her claim to the hallowed title of barrister. But alas, fate had other plans. A cruel whisper from mortality silenced her song before the final verse could be sung. Ivy Williams, a name forever etched in history, stood tall as the first woman to conquer that formidable peak. A bittersweet victory, a testament to Bebb's unwavering spirit, forever silenced by the cruel hand of destiny.

### Original Text:
Well, that was a blast! First i want to thank Kaggle of course for setting up the great competition, and my awesome teammate ,It's been a real honor working with you, i learned a lot! Thank you for deciding to work with me. This has been an incredible competition. I'll put emphasis on the non model processes I ran in order to support and enhance Silogram's models. There were so many iterations of my solution, I will only mention the last solution. Also - non of the things written here are facts, just my findings personal findings. The main thing that guided me was Lynn's note : The logic of our labeling is define reported chargeback on the card as fraud transaction (isFraud=1) and transactions posterior to it with either user account, email address or billing address directly linked to these attributes as fraud too. After some EDA i found that once a customer is fraud once, most of the time all future transactions will also be fraud. My goal was to create groups of cards that if we find 1 of them as fraud, then we can mark them all as fraud, and also to retain the frauds we have in train set and mark these customers as frauds in the future. We could use grouping by card, date-d1, addr1+2, dist1+2 to identify customers but there are lots of NAs, if only addr1 is different it could be a different customer, and when it's NA, we can't know who it is, So i took a different approach. I'll start with the groupings that i used, and continue with how i came about finding those, all these were done using an iterative script .Within each of these grouping there are multiple sanity checks to consider for lost information due to missing data. for example - V307 is not simple cumsum of TranscationAmt, it's for last 30 days, if a card has more than 1 consecutive month of data, , sometimes V307 won't be equal to previous V307 + previous Transaction Amount, also if a customer had more than 30 days between transactions, V307 loses its signal and becomes 0. I'm not able to list all the checks and rounds, but i'll say the general guidelines. 1) Customer\Card: Use unique_card1-6 and date-D1, identify next transaction by V307 = CumSum(TransactionAmt) in last 30 days (TransactionDT - 2592000), and either Date-D3 =date of previous transaction or V322= previous V322 +1 (when D3 is NA) 2 ) 1 type of User grouping. Group by id_19+id_20+id_31+DeviceInfo, next transaction identified by V264= CumSum(TransactionAmt) in last 30 days (TransactionDT - 2592000), V218= previous transaction V218+ 1, and shares same D1 or D4 3 ) another type of User grouping. Group by id_19+id_20+id_31+DeviceInfo, next transaction identified by V203= CumSum(TransactionAmt) in last 30 days (TransactionDT - 2592000), V168 = previous transaction V168 + 1, and shares same D8 The ""User Grouping"" ones span across different cards Some of them are relevant for specific ProductCDs.This allowed me to fill many NAs in the data, in addr, dist, card features. My output for the ensemble was: 1) a 50 feature. 9492 lgbm that eventually wasn't used. It was craeted before the groupings 2) per each transaction,its card group id, user1 group ID and user2 group ID. Also i grouped together all groups that are related. Is we have group X with 8 transactions, and one of them is also part of group Y, create 1 grouping for all of them (as a new type). 3) in order to retain customer frauds into the future, i joined all test transactions with all fraud transactions in train, and created features such as ""is same addr"", ""is dist na"", does past transaction's group has within it a matching addr"", ""do their groups share any transaction amounts "" etc. I then trained a model to identify the probability that the transaction at hand is of the same customer as any of the frauds we know in the past. Using these, Silogram was able to use additional features in the ensemble to enable the model to take transaction that it found as fraud, and to mark the transaction's entire group as higher fraud probability. I'm sure there was a lot more to do, both Silogram and i had breakthroughs on the last day that allowed us to boost our score significantly, but not enough time to explore further. I think now, after reading the other write ups - i might have took too conservative way to do the groupings, or picked logics that would generate the groups with not as good quality as others did.I did lots and lots of EDA, but probably i got myself too tired with lack of sleep, and sometimes i would just stare at the data while my brain melts.Might have been worth to revisit all of my assumptions from scratch with a new perspective from time to time. ........... As a side note. I used a power Bi model in the start of competition to allow myself drag and drop and object interactions functionality in a dashboard. It was of great value because on the fly i could drag card, addr, D1, and have a measurement that that shows me all those that have both rows in train and test, have frauds, and that after 1st fraud, there are only frauds onwards. Clicking on 1 of the groups would bring up their transactions. This allows quick and intuitive hands on EDA that you code once, and then analyze on the fly from then on. I do it in almost every competition and it's an awesome tool for immediate, interactive ,hands on interaction with the data ......... Thank you all for reading, Thank you for being such an awesome community. You're all truly a unique group of people

Subject: Final Thoughts on the Kaggle Competition - A Professional Perspective Dear Kaggle Community, As the competition comes to a close, I would like to share my final thoughts on the experience. First and foremost, I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to Kaggle for organizing an exceptional competition. The dataset provided was intriguing, and the challenge of identifying fraudulent transactions was both engaging and intellectually stimulating. I would also like to express my sincere appreciation to my teammate, whose collaboration made this journey even more enjoyable and productive. Moving on to my personal experience, I must say that this competition was a rollercoaster ride of emotions. From the initial excitement of exploring the dataset to the frustration of dealing with missing values and inconsistent data, I encountered a multitude of challenges. However, I learned to embrace these obstacles and view them as opportunities for growth. Throughout the competition, I employed various techniques to handle the missing data, including imputation methods and feature engineering. I also experimented with different grouping strategies to identify fraudulent transactions. One of the most significant challenges I faced was the lack of sleep. As the deadline approached, I found myself working tirelessly to optimize my model and ensure a satisfactory performance. However, I soon realized that my brain was melting, and I needed to take a break. I learned that it's essential to maintain a healthy work-life balance, especially when participating in competitions like this. In retrospect, I believe that I took a conservative approach to grouping the transactions. While my methodology yielded decent results, I could have explored alternative techniques to improve the quality of the groups. I also recognize that I might have been too focused on the non-model processes, neglecting the potential benefits of incorporating additional features into the ensemble. As a side note, I found the Power BI model to be an invaluable tool throughout the competition. Its drag-and-drop functionality allowed me to perform quick and intuitive EDA, enabling me to visualize the data and identify patterns with ease. In conclusion, this competition has been a transformative experience for me. I have learned the importance of persistence, creativity, and collaboration in solving complex problems. I am grateful for the opportunity to have participated in this event and look forward to future competitions on Kaggle. Thank you once again to Kaggle and my teammate for making this experience unforgettable. Best regards, [Your Name]

Thanks Chris and Konstantin for so clearly explaining your solution and providing awesome kernels like this one! I was able to reproduce everything locally on the first try. One minor issue: the current feature ""missing"" is all 0s because of the earlier fillna(-1). Suggest letting the missings ride and changing to missing=np.nan in all of the XGBClassifier calls, the reason being there could easily be real -1s in the data since we are taking differences of integers in many places. I made this change and scores improve a smidgeon (~0.00025). I'm also seeing around a 0.001 improvement in private score when reducing max_depth from 12 to 8. A big congratulations to you and Konstantin for a stellar performance!

Here is a more constructive and actionable feedback for the given scenario: Dear Chris and Konstantin, Thank you for taking the time to explain your solution and provide valuable kernels. I was able to reproduce your results locally without any issues. However, I noticed a minor improvement opportunity in your code. In the current feature ""missing,"" all values are 0s due to the earlier fillna(-1). I suggest leaving the missing values as np.nan, as there could be real -1s in the data from taking differences of integers in various places. By changing all XGBClassifier calls to missing=np.nan, you may observe a slight improvement (~0.00025). Additionally, reducing the max_depth from 12 to 8 resulted in a 0.001 improvement in private score. Great job on developing a straightforward, insightful, and principled approach that has won the day! It's impressive that you and Konstantin have demonstrated such a strong performance. Keep up the excellent work, and I look forward to seeing your future contributions! Best regards, [Your Name]

There are a few reasons why people in some parts of the world, such as the Netherlands and other Western European countries, are taller on average than people in other parts of the world. One reason is genetics. People inherit traits such as height from their parents, and certain genetic traits that contribute to taller height may be more common in some populations than in others. 
Another reason is nutrition. People who have access to a varied and nutritious diet are more likely to grow to be tall and healthy. This is especially true during childhood and adolescence, when the body is still growing. In the past, people in the Netherlands and other Western European countries may have had better access to nutritious food, which could have contributed to their taller average height. 
There are also other factors that can affect height, such as health care and living conditions. People who live in countries with good health care and safe, clean living conditions are more likely to grow to be tall and healthy. So, the combination of genetics, nutrition, and other factors has likely contributed to the taller average height of people in the Netherlands and other Western European countries.

### Rewriten Text:
Hey there, youngster! Let me tell you something cool - did you know that some people in certain parts of the world are taller than others? Yeah, it's true! And there are some pretty cool reasons why.
First of all, it's got to do with genetics. You know how some people inherit traits from their parents? Well, height is one of those things. Some people might be born with genes that make them taller than others, and that can make a big difference.
But it's not just genetics. Nutrition plays a big role too! If people have access to healthy food and a balanced diet, they're more likely to grow up tall and strong. And that's especially true during childhood and adolescence, when the body is still growing and developing.
Oh, and there's more! Other factors can also affect how tall someone grows. For example, if people have good health care and live in safe, clean places, they're more likely to be healthy and grow up tall. It's like a big puzzle, and all these things work together to decide how tall someone will be.
So, that's why people in some parts of the world might be taller than others. It's not just because they're lucky - it's because of all these cool factors that work together!

I am writing to follow up on my submission for the [Kaggle Competition Name] competition. As you may recall, I encountered an error during the submission process and would like to bring it to your attention. Upon reviewing my submission, I noticed that I had hard-coded values in my network that did not match the test.csv file provided for the competition. It appears that Kaggle uses different test.csv files for when you commit and when you submit your notebook, and my network was not able to handle the different sequence lengths present in the submission test.csv file. To resolve this issue, I simply ensured that my network could handle sequence lengths of any size, and it worked.

['Sometimes when we eat certain types of food, our brain releases chemicals that make us feel good. These chemicals are called ""pleasure chemicals."" When we eat food that tastes really good, our brain releases more pleasure chemicals, and we feel really happy. Sometimes we crave food that is not healthy for us because it makes us feel good. However, it is important to remember that even though something may taste really good, it may not be good for our bodies.

Target Text: The synapses in our cerebral cortex fire off dopamine and serotonin, conjuring a sense of euphoria. The more delectable the cuisine, the more potent the neurotransmitters, and the more we succumb to the allure of gastronomic pleasure. But beware, for the allure of the palate can be a siren's call, luring us down a path of indulgence that may ultimately prove detrimental to our bodily well-being.

### Original Text:
I wonder if NFL team analytics can improve it with extra data they collect. For instance, if the raw data indicates which defender tackled the rusher, it might be used to improve this model

### Rewriten Text:
As someone who holds a fundamentally different worldview, I would argue that the NFL's reliance on analytics and data-driven decision-making is misguided and ultimately limited in its ability to improve team performance. Here are some insights and advice from my perspective: 1. The Limits of Data: While data can provide valuable insights, it can never fully capture the complexity and nuance of human behavior and decision-making. The NFL is a high-stakes, fast-paced, and unpredictable environment that cannot be fully understood through numbers alone. 2. The Importance of Intuition: Intuition and instinct play a crucial role in football, particularly at the line of scrimmage. Coaches and players must be able to read the game and make split-second decisions based on their experience and instincts, rather than solely relying on data. 3. The Need for Context: Data is only useful in the context of the game situation and the opponent being faced. Analytics cannot account for the emotional and psychological factors that come into play during a game, such as the momentum of a team or the fatigue of players. 4. The Dangers of Overreliance: Relying too heavily on analytics can lead to a lack of creativity and adaptability on the field. Teams that rely solely on data may struggle to adjust their strategies when faced with unexpected situations or opponents. 5. The Importance of Human Judgment: While data can provide valuable insights, it is ultimately up to the coaches and players to interpret and apply that data in a way that maximizes their chances of success. Human judgment and experience are essential for making the right decisions in the heat of the moment. 6. The Need for Balance: A balanced approach to analytics and decision-making is key to success in the NFL. Teams that strike the right balance between data-driven insights and human intuition are more likely to achieve long-term success. 7. The Limits of Predictive Modeling: Predictive modeling is a powerful tool, but it is limited in its ability to account for the unpredictable nature of the game. Models can only predict the likelihood of certain outcomes based on past data, but they cannot guarantee success. 8. The Importance of Adaptability: The NFL is a constantly evolving environment, and teams that are able to adapt quickly to changing circumstances are more likely to succeed. Analytics can provide valuable insights, but they cannot replace the ability to adapt and adjust on the fly. 9. The Need for a Holistic Approach: A truly successful NFL team must take a holistic approach to analytics and decision-making, considering not just the raw data but also the broader context of the game and the opponent being faced. 10. The Importance of Humility: Finally, it is important for teams to approach analytics with humility and a recognition of the limitations of data. No amount of data can replace the experience and intuition of coaches and players, and teams that are too quick to rely on data may find themselves struggling to adapt to the complex and unpredictable nature of the game
